This journal is private and you shouldn’t be reading it. Shame on you. But since you’re here, a few warnings: Vernon isn’t great at spelling, espeically when it comes to names of people, places, and races. He’s more of a talker than a writer. Vernon doesn’t always write in his journal at regular intervals, sometimes there is a large span of time between entries. This can result in brief descriptions of seemingly important events and long winded descriptions of frivolity. He simply can’t remember the details for very long so the amount of attention an event is given in his journal is more related to how soon after he wrote about it than of how important it was. As I said, this is a private journal so you shouldn’t be reading it anyway. Therefore, no complaining about points 1 and 2. "],["background.html", "Background", " Background After the power of That-Which-Endures mutated the verdan, my parents both eventually made their way to Athkatla, in Amn. It was there that they met, fell in love, and made me. They were both “jack-of-all-trades” types, involved in many enterprizes and made a decent living, considering. They gave themselves the family name Vickies when they married because, coincidentally, they had both taken the name Vicky at some point in their past. They named me Vernon because they thought it sounded cheerful and friendly and they wanted me to have a lot of friends. I think they also had a thing for alliteration, or maybe just the letter V. When I was still an infant, one of the many corrupt government officials of the city tricked many people in our neighboorhood into some bad investments that ended with them losing their home, all their money, and ruining their reputation (so any claims made against the official would go unsubstantiated). We, along with many others, were forced to move into the slums and my parents struggled to find work due to their ruined reputation. It wasn’t long thereafter that a sickness spread through the slums and took many lives, including my parents. My parents were well liked in the area and I was taken care of by some of their elvish friends from the old neighbourhood who had also been victims of the corrupt official and were now in the slums. The squalid conditions were hard on them and it was only a few years before they too were dead. I was left with little choice except a life of petty crime in order to scrape by. That is, until a magnificent dwarf “merchant” named Whutun Brownthane passed through and changed my life forever. He was a master of deception and specialized in lightening the coffers of the elite. He saw potential in me and took me under his wing. Whutun said I was a natural in the heat of the moment (meaning I could talk/lie my way out of most situations) but that I wasn’t smart enough to avoid those situations in the first place. He tried to install planning and critical thinking in me, but they didn’t stick. I still take things as they come and hope for the best instead of worrying about what might happen, sometimes to my detriment. Whutun was a good fellow but he was less concerned with righting wrong and more concerned with making money and not getting caught. He didn’t care if the rich deserved to lose money and he never took all they had, or even enough to ruin them… usually. I was more interested in taking EVERYTHING from what I saw as evil people getting rich at the expense of the poor and vulnerable, and then givning my earnings to the ones that need it most. Our motivations didn’t align enough for us to be professional partners, so once I graduated from the Brownthane school of charlantry, we amicably parted ways. I will always be greatful to him for the kindness he showed me and the skills he imparted. I spent several of my adult years travelling from city to city, fleecing a few corrupt bureaucrats and nobles in each, before moving on to the next. On one fateful occassion, I was posing as an elf in the house staff for a particularly nasty noble to gain info in order to steal his fortune and destroy him. I soon discovered he was not just corrupt, but evil, crazy, and stupid. He had summoned a demon to make a pact with in order to have his business competitors destroyed (why not just hire assassins? Like I said, stupid.). The demon demanded a sacrifrice before he would provide any services so the noble called for one of his staff - me. Being the smooth talker that I am, I stalled the nobleman and convinced him to let me parley with the demon to get him a better deal. Obviously, I didn’t care about the nobleman’s plans, I just didn’t want the demon to devour my soul. The demon seemed intrigued by me and made a deal that if I killed the nobleman then he “would not consume my soul this day”. I normally didn’t kill my marks, but they often succumbed to something not long after I stole every copper they had and ruined their reputation, so actually killing one didn’t seem that much to ask, so I did it. I was under a lot of pressure, staring into the face of a demon for the first time, with a man not-so-patiently waiting behind me ready to kill me, so I didn’t think things all the way through. What I failed to realise was that I wasn’t getting the demon the spare my soul, I was getting him to spare it -for now-. Of course that means I now have to keep killing in order to appease the morbid obsession of my new demon friend… So from then on I was a warlock. Oops. This new arrangement didn’t stop me from fleecing nobles and my demonic patron doesn’t seem to care that I give the money I steal away to the poor, which is nice of him. The only problem is that he requires that I cause more death and descruction than I’m comfortable with. Instead of just tricking nobles out of their fortunes and letting life take them down however it sees fit, the demon on my back insists I kill them myself, which can get messy and complicated. Not that I mind them being dead, they were human garbage, but it makes it much harder to get away cleanly. Luckily he bestowed upon me the means to deal out the death and destruction he longs for. There isn’t a pattern to when he requires a death and he never stipulates who I kill, he just sends a message, by various means, that says “someone must die by sundown tomorrow or I will devour your soul”. He always communicates with me in Infernal, but our pact seems to have included fluency in the language so I’m able to understand him. He seems to be watching me, as I almost always receive such a message the day before an important part of whatever current plan I’m working on, which means I either put my plan on hold to find someone that deserves to die, or I just kill the person I’m stealing from. Because of these increased pressures, I’m taking a break from “mass wealth redistribution” to search out more “violence appropriate” ways to make the world a better place in order to appease both my conscience and the appetite of my patron. If it gets to a point where I must choose between doing what I think is right and having my demon “friend” consume my soul, or commit a heinous act of violence to keep my soul… I like to think I’ll choose death, but I don’t know. "],["prologue.html", "Prologue", " Prologue My first adventure began in Port Crawl, a small town in the southern part of the Sword Coast. I joined a group of adventurers who were on their way to explore the recently found Lost Tomb of Pav the Magnificent. I didn’t know what to expect, I just wanted to get some experience and the folks I joined with seemed to know what they were doing. Dorn Ironskull, dwarf (male) Tav Orin, half-elf (male) Vawen Loww’elai, elf (female) While exploring the tomb we found a collapsed tunnel and decided to explore it. Is this tunnel we were ambushed by drow who managed to subdue my entire party. They knocked me out during the battle and I woke up in some kind of prison cart that was little more than a big box attached to a carriage that was stuffed with prisoners. My hands and legs were shackled to a collar and belt so I could barely move. I don’t know how long I was in the box but it felt like a very long time. I would guess at least a full day. After what felt like forever just sitting in the box as we rolled along I started to hear the buildup of some kind of droning sound. It gets so loud it seems to vibrate the carriage. Soon after I start to hear ear splitting shrieks and panicked screams in a language I don’t understand and then the carriage seemed to pick up speed. After a sort while the carriage stops abruptly and I can hear sounds of fighting. I hear the roar of what sounds like a large beast while the shrieking and fighting continues. Abruptly the shrieking stops and something is thudding against the carriage and it starts to shake. Suddenly the roof is half ripped off and flung away. I see a pair of bulbous glowing spheres (eyes?) before what’s left of the roof collapses and traps me in the corner. The roof seems to protect me from whatever is now in the carriage, but it also hit me in the head when it collapsed. Just as I’m passing out I see Dorn slumped unconcious with a large gash in his head and I hear Vawen scream, as well as the sounds of other prisoners dying. "],["entry-1-escape-from-captivity.html", "Entry 1 - Escape from captivity", " Entry 1 - Escape from captivity 2020/01/04 I awoke to the sound of Vawen talking to someone on the other side of the carriage roof that had trapped me in the corner. It took some work, but the man managed to helpe me out of the carriage and removed my shackles. It was a human rogue named Gilberto who had saved us. He is in a party of escaped prisoners. Vawen’s leg was broken in the carriage carnage so she needed help getting out of the carriage. Prince Darrendil, a huge creature I’ve never seen before tried to climb up to help but ended up tipping the carriage over. After dusting myself off, I checked of Dorn, who was a bit shaken from his head blow but otherwise seeme hale. Vawen leg needed to be splinted so I set about making her a splint and attempting to set her leg. Prine Darrendil agreed to carry her. Before leaving we checked the area for useful supplies and we found a chest that contained the prisoners’ gear. I found all of my gear except for my gold, my arcane focus, and my fake signet ring. Gilberto grabbed some of the other gear. I got a drow dagger from Gilberto and grabbed a drow cloak off a corpse in case I need to disguise myself later. I met the rest of the group, Dezo, Verril, Zakham, Neznar, and a gnome I forget the name of. The group seemed to be in a discussion with something I couldn’t see and then I heard it, Stoop, the micanid. This creature/being could speak to us telepathically and the group were on their way to bring it home to Neverlight Grove, somewhere in the Underdark. Neznar, being a drow, was leading them, although he has never been there. There has been a lot of fighting between the drow and giant wasps, which have left many of the corpses bloated and we are worried they might become undead so we deided to hurry up an leave. There is waterfall nearby and I suggest refilling our waterskins while we pass it. Gilberto doesn’t want to waste time going to get water, he just wants to leave. Neznar tells us there are a few paths we could take. There is a cliff we could climb down but it would be difficult, especially with Vawen’s broken leg, and Neznar says there would be many climbs down and up. The other option is longer but easier walking, although will also have dangers. We agreed that we wouldn’t leave Vawen behind so we decided on the longer route. Neznar sneeringly said “she’s a liability”, which I didn’t like, but I don’t want to make trouble with our guide so I’ll leave it for now, as long as he doesn’t act on it. On our way to the waterfall we see what appear to be floating lights. Once we get closer we see they are lanterns. As we get closer still, we begin to notice a foul, garbage-like stench that gets stronger as we move forward. We see a collapsed tower partly submerged in water/muck. The other mention something about sacrifices that they seemed to have avoided, but think this is where the bodies have ended up. We decide against drinking this water. There are balls of light floating in the water/muck but I can’t tell what they are. We decide to leave the area and continue on our way. As we continue we start to notice a fog. I ask Neznar about it but he just says to “keep moving and focus”. I ask him if i’s dangerous and he says “not if you keep moving and focus”… not very helpful. I started to hear faint whispers coming from nowhere that I can’t make out. There appear to be scratch marks on the walls from claws and things are generally very creepy, but we have to keep moving. I don’t know what happened next. Suddenly my head cleared and we weren’t in the fog anymore. We seemed to have travelled a fair distance but I’m unsure how much time passed. Most of us don’t seem to remember what happened, but something definitely did. Gilberto is bleeding from the head but doens’t know why. Dorn said “Fuck you, that’s why” so something must have happened between them that only Dorn knows about. Dezo tells Zakham that he forgives him but Zahkam doesn’t know what he’s being forgiven for. Dezo says “you didn’t know what you were doing” so I guess some of us were under some kind of magical effect? Other than a few minor injuries we seem to have escaped mostly unharmed from whatever was in that fog. As we continue walking we come to a cave in blocking our path. Neznar gives us options again. We can go back 20 minutes to a ladder leadin down, but our current party can’t really make that climb. We can try to dig out the cave in and continue on our route, but that would take a lot of time. We can go up to a path/cavern that the cave in seems to have opened up. We decide to go up to the new revealed area and find ourselves on a kind of plateau. The walls in this area seem to pulsate with an orange glow. There are vein like structures in the rock that the light pulses seem to travel along. There is a large fissure 10~15 feet wide and 20~30 feet high. The area seems safe so we decide to take a long rest here. We post watches, and I’m first. I feel fine and shouldn’t have trouble staying awake but about 1.5 hours into my 2 hour watch a suddenly fall asleep. My patron came to me in my sleep, and it seems he is the reason I fell asleep. He demanded that I kill either Vawen or the gnome in our party. I really don’y want to kill an innocent person, but if I don’t give him one of those souls, he will take mine. Luckily, he didn’t give me a deadline, so hopefully I can find out more about this gnome and he’ll end up being a pretty terrible person and I won’t have to feel bad about killing him. The other option is killing Vawen because of her leg. I don’t want to, but if it gets infected or we need to run and she has to be left behind, I might kill her in order save her from the fate of being caught by whatever we’re runnin from. So what I need to do once I wake up is: investigate the gnome, find out if he’s a bad guy that I can kill investigate Vawen’s leg and find out if she’s going to survive "],["entry-2-murder-in-the-night.html", "Entry 2 - Murder in the night", " Entry 2 - Murder in the night 2020/01/25 Zahkam woke me up and took over watch. I feel bad about falling asleep but I know it wasn’t my fault. I’ve got a lot to think about so I gladly let Zahkam take over as I try to fall into a natural sleep to get some real rest. I was rudely awoken by Verril slapping me, and apparently everyone else as well, because he saw something while on watch. During the night Vawyn was murdered. Not regular murder though, ritualistically, with her intestines spread around her in a circle and all of her organs removed from her body. Neznar isn’t around but he left his belongings (Gilberto checked for clues in his stuff). Verril and I laid Vawyn’s body to rest as nicely as we could with a grave of piles rocks. We all investigated the scene of the crime and Dezo discovered that she had her neck broken and had several other wounds but it wasn’t clear what the killing blow had been. Her body was dragged from her bed to where the mutilated body was left on display. The were no bloody footprints or other marks around the body, which was concerning. While Gilberto saw Neznar coming up the tunnel and went to confront him. Stoop’s spores, which help us understand each other regardless of our language had worn off so Gilberto and Neznar couldn’t understand each other. Neznar could tell something had happened so he stormed into camp and a lot of yelling followed. Eventually, Dezo got Prince Darrendil to grab Neznar so we could interogate him. We all got some spores from Stoop and communication could finally begin in earnest. Neznar genuinely doesn’t seem to know what had happened. He had been out gathering supplies and has a sack of mushrooms so I’m inclined to believe him. He also made an argument about not wasting time with a ritual like that if he wanted to kill someone. He escaped from Prince Darrendil’s grasp and waiped his hand on the prince’s mouth and it came away bloody. Darrendil doesn’t seem to know where the blood came from, which hints at some kind of possession or him losing himself to his Quaggoth form (p.s. I learned he’s an elf in the body of a Quaggoth… I’ve gotten mixed up with some weird people. What the hell is a Quaggoth? Other than a huge super strong thing? Apparently they are usually kind of dumb and ‘beastly’). He doens’t seem a likely candidate for the ritualistic killing of Vawyn. If she had been savagely ripped to pieces, maybe. But he’d be covered in more blood, there wouldn’t just be some in his mouth. I tried accusing the gnome (Boopido) to see if he would panic and confess but he genuinely seems disturbed by the whole thing. I bit of a confrontation happened between Gilberto and me over the accusation of Boopido and I ended up telling everyone about my demon patron and his instructions to kill Vawyn or Boopido. They were less than thrilled and Boopido definitely doesn’t like or trust me. Zahkam and myself really wanted to get moving but Gilberto, and maybe Dezo, wanted to stay and figure out who the killer was. The lack of bloody footprints was puzzling so we shot an illuminated cross bow bolt up into the air and discovered that the cavern is REALLY high. Maybe something came down and killed her? How would it do it so quietly that no one woke up? When did it happen? Zahkam didn’t see anything on watch. If it happened when I was asleep, it happened quickly, before Zahkam woke up. He can’t see in the dark so I suppose it makes sense that he didn’t notice a dead body… Zahkam is a moron with a ridiculously inappropriate sense of humour. In other circumstances I probably would have laughed, but he claimed to have killed Vawyn. He was only joking, in an attempt to get us to leave. We eventually believed him when he said he was joking, but damn, what an idiot. Eventually, Zahkam and I managed to convince everyone that there was nothing to be gained from staying so we finally left. We continued to talk as we walked, still trying to figure out who could have done it. I’m leaning towards someone or something outside our party, but I don’t know how or why. I’m also puzzled and concerned why my demon chose Vawyn and Boopido as my options for killing. I also don’t know what happens now that Vawyn already died. Does that mean I have to kill Boopido, or does it mean it’s done? I wasn’t given a time limit so I’ll just do nothing for now. I told Boopido as much, but I’m pretty sure he still thinks I want to kill him. Eventually, we came to a cavern with a pool. A few of us drank and filled our canteens, but Verril (maybe stupider than Zahkam) jumped right in, almost fully clothed. He started panaicking and flailing so I tried to throw him a rope…but I’ve never thrown a rope before and I failed misserable. Zahkam came and helped me and we dragged Verril out of the water. He had gotten bitten by some underwater creature with long tentacles that we could just barely make out. We quickly moved on from there. We came to another cavern with many types of mushrooms around. This is where Neznar had come for supplies. I asked him which mushrooms were the best and after he pointed some out, I started collecting them with Gilberto. Verril went off and started eating other mushrooms which ended up poisoning him (definitely dumber than Zahkam, by a lot). Dezo made a fire from some dried compost like materials so we could cook the mushrooms and then went to investigate something. Gilberto went to give Dezo some mushrooms when suddenly a fungus-undead “thing” came apart from the wall and attacked Dezo. This creature was attached to another in the wall and it soon also detached and joined the fight. These creatures seemed to all be attached to each other in a way and the room was soon full of them. A fierce battle followed and we suffered several injuries but no casualties. Neznar had gone to the other end of the cavern and began cutting the “roots” of the monsters before they came out of the wall. He was only able to get a few before the rest were all out and attacking us. Prince Darrendil want mad with rage and savagely destroyed a few of the monsters. Dorn took a few knocks but seems ok. Verril is barely hanging on. There were some poisonous mushrooms on the ground that released a toxis cloud when stepped on. Prince Darrendil, Dorn, and Verril were all affected. Dezo, Gilberto, Neznar, and myself are in good condition. Boopido is also fine, since he ran and hid during the fight. This was my first real battle with “monsters”. Having allies in the front to keep the enemy away from me made things much easier for me, which is good, because I panicked and my first few shots went horribly wide. I got into my stride after that though, and think I did alright. After the battle Gilberto and I checked the bodies. Among the 10+ corpses we found a few ancient looking sacs/pouches that had some niceties inside. We found some gold, silver, and gemstones as well as a mysterious potion. It contains a cloudy green coagulated-looking liquid and the condition of the cork implies magic. It could be useful but it could also be dangerous. We need to tend to our wounds before continuing on to Neverlight Grove. I just remembered something… Neznar has that weird mark on his face and mutters to himself a lot. Maybe he has a split personallity or gets possessed or something? I believe him when he says he wouldn’t kill Vawyn like that, but what if he didn’t, but something inside him did, or someone/something used his body to do it? I should bring this us to the group. "],["entry-3-surfing-the-webs.html", "Entry 3 - Surfing the webs", " Entry 3 - Surfing the webs 2020/02/29 As we take stock of our physical condition and catch our breath, Prince Darrendil has some kind of breakdown and lets out a loud growl/roar before running up the wall and through a tunnel. I find this allarming but the rest of the party doesn’t seem bothered by it. I just hope that he’s ok and returns before long. We decide to rest before moving on. Neznar says that the way Prince Darrendil went is the way we need to go anyway, so if he doesn’t return by the time we’re rested we’ll go after him. Zahkam sings us a soothing song as we settle down to rest and it helps rejuvenate us. While we’re resting Gilberto goes through some papers he pulled out of his knickers. He says he got from some office when they were escaping. It seems to mostly be in under-common, which he can’t read, but some of them seem of a personal nature. He’s hesitant to ask for Neznar’s help deciphering them. A puzzle for another time. Prince Darrendil didn’t return while we rested so we set off after him. Once in the tunnel I have another look at Neznar’s face with a glowing dagger courtesy of Verril. Neznar notices me examining him so I just ask him about it and he says it’s a birthmark. It’s a pretty gnarly birthmark if that’s true, but I don’t sense any deception from him. That doesn’t mean I believe him, I just can’t tell if he’s lying. Similar to how I don’t trust Boopido. I think the problem is that I’m such a good liar that I’m afraid everyone else is too so I might not be able to tell if they are lying. I certainly don’t want to be murdered in my sleep, but our lives are very much in Neznar’s hands for now. We walk for what feels like ages, through tunnels of various sizes, some feeling a tad cramped, others more spacious. We eventually come to a large ‘room’ with many exits. There are natural pillar-like structures that appear to be holding the cave up, but that might just be my imagination, I’m no geologist (though I have impersonated one before). Anyway, Neznar seems to know where he’s going and leads us down one of the tunnels. Eventually we start to hear running water and growling that sounds like it could be Prince D. We also hear talking in the distance that could be drow. We cautiously continue on and come to a river but don’t see anyone around. There are large claw marks on the ground that could have been made by a quaggoth. The river is shallow so we can simply wade accross. Verril tries to catch some of the small fish in his hands but they are too slippery. Before heading on we realize that we are likely going to end up in a fight. Maybe it’s the stress, or maybe I still don’t trust him, but I was a serious dick to Boopido about him not participating in the last battle at all. He’s a tiny old gnome that (unless he’s hiding something) has no martial or magical abilities to speak of, so I shouldn’t be surprised that he just hides when things get violent. I offer to show him how to use a crossbow next time we rest so he can help us out. We can hear sounds of battle and what sounds like Prince D. roaring (screeming?) so we run ahead to try to get to him to help if he’s in trouble. There are several paths but Neznar grabs my shoulder and tells me “If you want to save your friends, go that way”. There is a tunnel that leads straight down about 40 feet with a faint blue glow at the bottom. We can see shadows so we know there is something/someone down there. There are three grappling hooks set up for rapelling down so we decide that Neznar, Gilberto, and Verril should go down first and then myself, Dezo and Zahkam will follow, with Boopido and Dorn taking up the rear. This goes astray almost immediately. The first three get down the ropes alright but once at the bottom Neznar accidentaly steps on and breaks some crystals which alerts what turn out be drow in a room at the bottom where the blueish light is coming from. So before the rest of us get down there the fighting begins. Dezo makes it down the rope alright but Dorn, myself, and Zahkam have some trouble. Dorn and myself can’t quite get the hang of it and go down extrememly slowly. Painfully slowly. Zahkam was going slowly too but decided to try being fancy and slide down. He got down, but it looked like it hurt a bit. When Dorn and myself were around halfway down the roped gave way and we fell. I landed hard. Shortly after our fall, the fight was concluded with the last remaining drow running down a pasageway. My immediate thought was that Boopido cut the ropes, since he was still up top. It turned out they weren’t cut, just unhooked, but I still thought it was Boopido because who else could have done it? We looked around and looted the bodies and discovered that what we had thought might be the sounds of Prince Dareendil were in fact him. We didn’t get there in time to help him and he was overpowered by the drow and a quaggoth. I yelled up to Boopido at the top of the cliff to see what had happened and he claims he didn’t know. He denies unhooking the ropes and claims he had gone back over to the river when the fighting was going on because he was scared. Verril tried to throw the rope up so that Boopido could come down but he failed in his first attempt and gave up and walked off. We ended up getting it hooked on and then there was a deafening explosion that occured when Verril hit the glowing crystal structure in the middle of the room with his sword. He broke a piece off, which is what he wanted, but he could have killed himself and us. Luckily no one was hurt, but I gave him a few stern words. The explosion didn’t help with coaxing Boopido down the cliff but I eventually convinced him to come down so we could get going. We looted the bodies and buried Prince Derrendil before going after the last drow that had run away because Neznar said it was the way to Neverlight Grove. As we continue to walk we get to another cavern with mutliple tunnels and natural pillar-like structures. We also pass a large obelisk. As we continue to walk for several more hours we occasionally hear faint chittering. I don’t know what it is but I don’t like it. Neznar guides us and helps us avoid issues, having us pause/hide/sneak by things that sound menacing but we can’t see, such as the flapping of large wings. I’m happy not knowing what creatures we almost saw. This is still my first adventure and think I might have picked a real doozy. Maybe after a few more months or years of experience I’ll be ready to face whatever monster comes my way, but for now I’m happy to hide and sneak when possible. We manage to avoid further incident and eventually come to an open area with a large archway that has lights around chest height. As we approach the archway we begin to hear the sound of wind rushing and the air begins to shimmer. The archway is at the edge of a cliff of an enormous gorge. The gorge is filled with an immense expanse of giant spider webs. Some of the webs look quite old and some look new. Some of the webs look strong enough to walk on as a way to cross the gorge. The idea of walking across the gorge does not fill me with joy, but Neznar says that’s the way. He says we should stick to the older webs, as they likely don’t have active spiders patrolling or mainting them, but not to walk on the really old ones, as they might fall apart. Before we can set out we see two figures approach very rapidly. They seem to be sliding on the webs somehow. Once they approach us we see they are goblins, one short and one tall (for a goblin). They were riding a small sled that they stand on, as a way to quickly traverse the webs. Their names are Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait. Yuk Yuk is the short one and is very lively and seems fond of shiny things (going by the amount of jewelry he wears). Sdider Bait is the taller one and seems very morose, but maybe it’s just that he talks slowly in a monotone voice and dresses plainly, especially compared to his companion. As they approach I can hear them shooting the shit in goblin, which I decide not to let them know I understand… yet. It may come in handy later. They say something about customers and seem to perk up a bit. It turns out they are guides for the webs, which they call the Silken Paths. They seem very competant and friendly and Neznar thinks they would be helpful as guides since he doesn’t know the webs so we decide to hire them for the reasonable price (… I have no idea what reasonable is for giant spider web guides, but it’s what I tell myself) of 10 gold pieces per day for the pair of them. They expect it to take 2 days to get to the edge of the webs that will get us to Neverlight Grove. With the arrangements confirmed and paid for, we are set to set off… or so I thought. We were given the choice of walking the webs or riding them on the small sleds. I immediately voted for the sleds since it would be faster and honestly, looked like fun. I was wrong. Before setting out we did some stationary practice. Boopido wasn’t confident so Zahkam offered to carry him. I thought it would be easy but I struggled and almost fell when we weren’t even moving! At least I got a light source. Yuk Yuk hands me a small sphere that erupts into a swarm of bugs that attach to my arm and give off light. Cool… I guess. Safer than a torch, since the webs are supposedly pretty flammable. As we set off I continue to struggle at web-boarding but I manage to not completely wipe out and fall to my death. Yuk Yuk is in the lead and Spider Bait is in the back, with the rest of us in between. Eventually, Yuk Yuk stops us because he sees a spider preparing some cocoons and then leaving. He suggests we loot the cocoons since the spiders don’t ‘clean’ their food before eating it and there could be some good stuff. He claims first pick but will let us have most of it. He jumps across a small gap in the webs and so do some of the others. When I go to jump, my foot lands in a soft spot and I start to fall and then I panic a bit and grab at the web and part of it breaks, causing others to fall as well. Everyone manages to catch something without falling too far, but I end up with a spider in my face and it quickly attacks me, biting me in the neck. Its poison burns through me and I feel myself weakend greatly. I manage to retaliate with some (oops) fire magic that destroys more of the webs. Luckily they didn’t all catch fire, but it caused more trouble for the others. I was so disoriented from falling and surprised from having a spider suddenly in my face and biting my neck that I was almost useless in the fight and the others had to save me. Gilberto lost consciousness and almost died from a spider bite to his neck but luckily we were able to save him and everyone else seemed ok. After climbing out we go on to loot the cocoons. There were three cocoons, the first two had some long dead human looking corpses and the third had a halfling that wasn’t quite dead. When he came to we learned his name is Fargas Rumblefoot and he had been crossing the webs with Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait. He was pretty upset with them for leaving him to die but we managed to calm him down. Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait are guides, not bodyguards or sworn protectors. They’ll help if they can but they won’t die saving their customers. I’ll chalk up Fargss’ hysteria to him waking up inside his cocoon. After a brief introduction we loot the other cocoons which contain a pouch with two small black spheres. Yuk Yuk takes one of the spheres as his share of the loot, since he called first pick. He says they are beads of force. I can imagine what they might do, but I’ll let Verril test the one we have left. I’m sure he’d love to, it’s just a matter of stopping him until the appropriate time. The corpses also had three red vials of an unknown substance, 5 unknown coins that aren’t quite silver but have a white glimmer to them, and some gold and rings. During the looting Fargas seems to be looking for something on his person that he can’t find at first and it seems cause him some distress. He does find it and seems very relieved but he didn’t take it out so I don’t know what it was. I’ll have to ask him about it later. With the looting completed we decide we should find a place to rest and talk, since Gilberto and myself are in very rough shape. Luckily, it took less than an hour to reach a safe area. It’s a very small hollowed out cave in a giant support pillar, roughly 20 by 20 feet. Now that we are safe we can rest and talk. We need to find out more about this Fargas character, such as why he’s down here, how he got here, how he plans to get out, and what was the item he was checking for when he got out of the cocoon? "],["entry-4-murder-mimic-and-spiders-oh-my.html", "Entry 4 - Murder, Mimic, and spiders… oh my", " Entry 4 - Murder, Mimic, and spiders… oh my 2020/03/21 NOTE FROM WILLY (aka, not Vernon or the historian who collected this priceless manuscript and compiled it into a book) I guess I was tired because I seem to have missed a conversation with Fargas about how he’s searching for treasure and would like us to help him. It comes up later that this conversation happened but I didn’t record it… oops. My only guess is that it happened before we went to bed, I don’t know when else we had the time. It is cold and windy in out ‘shelter’ so it’s not a very comfortable sleep, but we all do manage to get fall asleep. We agree to take watch in pairs in the hope of catching/stopping/preventing more nocturnal murders. Verril and Dezo take the first watch, with Zahkam and myself taking the second. It happens again - I very suddenly fall asleep while on watch, even though I felt wide awake a moment earlier. It seems Zahkam succumbed as well. As I fall asleep I hear the clack of bones on stone. I open my eyes and I’m on my back and see a huge black spider with a human like front with 8 balck eyes for a face. It’s huge, roughly 8 or 9 times my size. As she approaches me I try to move but can’t. She says &quot;On the path of silk someone has to sink. If they come back up, your blood I will dink&quot;. She then sinks her mandibles into my chest and I wake up with a start. My patron has visited my dreams again with another order to kill. I’m guessing it manifested as a giant spider in light on our current situation… that’s nice, bringing back the memory of almost dying yesterday. Shortly after I awake, everyone else wakes up too, because Fargas is screaming. I sit up and see Neznar staring out of the cave. Dorn’s dismembered body is hanging, almost floating in the cave entrance. He seems to have been ritualistically murdered like Vawyn. He is suspended by his intenstiines. Folk are quite shaken up. Fargas is frantic, Boopido looks terrified (as usual), and Gilberto looks like he might be sick. Verril, Dezo, and I decide to investigate the scene. The way the corpse is suspended it would be impossible for one person to do on their own. So magic was likely involved. There is a pool of blood where Dorn was sleeping, so he was killed, or at least wounded, before being brought to the entrance for the ritual. So likely someon strong, as well as magical. Great. We find that Gilberto’s loot bag has been rumaged through and the Bead of Force is missing and a kit of nails and such has been gone through. The money is all still there though. We are unable to find any clues that might indicate who or what did this. I sit everyone down and tell them about my dream. They are less than thrilled and the suspicion that I’m the killer (whether knowingly or not) increases. There isn’t much else to do so we see the Dorn’s body (burial at sea style, but in the sea of webs) and finish our rest before moving on. As we travel, following Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait, we come across big spider-like insects with orange/black shells pulling a wagon. The wagon is being driven by Durgen, the dwarves of the under dark. Yuk Yuk says they are salvers and that they were enslaved themselves by mindflayers for centuries and are about as nice as Drow. We’d prefer not to meet them. They are still ~200ft in the away so Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait lead us past/around them without incident. We continue on and Yuk Yuk spots an ornate chest in the webs off the main path. He wants to check it out but I suggest testing it from afar first. I get close enough to cast Mage Hand and try to open it. It’s not a chest, it’s a Mimic. Not. Good. I try to sneak away back to the group so we can escape without incident but it notices me. It is very fast. It gets hit with a few crossbow bolts before it reaches me but they don’t slow it down. As it reaches me I cast Burning Hands and definitely hurt it, but not nearly enough. I also accidentally destroy the web we’re on and we fall about 20 feet to a web below. The Mimic recovers first and latches on to my leg. Its bite burns like acid. I respond with more fire but in my pain am unable to properly direct the flames and can’t finish it off. Of course, I do manage to burn more of the web and we fall another 20 feet or so. It is so fast, it again recovers almost immediately and bites my legs again. I’m on my last legs *chuckle*. Verril tries to come down to help me but falls poorly and lands on the level below. Dezo casts some healing magic on me so I can possibly survivive one more bite. It is peppered with more bolts but they don’t stop it. The Mimic continues to try to consume me and I lost consciousness. I don’t think a lot of time passed before I was being revived by Dezo, with the destroyed ‘body’ of the Mimic on the web beside me. We hear some missing in the distance and Yuk Yuk wants to leave. First, Dezo examines the Mimic’s corpse and find a few acid marked gold pieces and a small lock box - eaten away by acid but still intact. As we are about the leave we hear the hisses much closer and realise there aer 5 spiders closing in on us. Zahkam tries to jump down but falls akwardly. Yuk Yuk yells that we should run because we can’t win this fight. I agree, since I’m barely hanging on. Unfortunately, we are spread between several levels of webs. Verril throws a rope down for Zahkam and Zahkam throws it down to Dezo so we can all climb back to the original web and escape. "],["entry-5-tricksy-old-goat.html", "Entry 5 - Tricksy old goat", " Entry 5 - Tricksy old goat 2020/04/04 We all got to the same level and run for it. I struggle on the webs again *sigh* but the others help me and we manage to get away. After about 20 minutes of running/riding we approach some lights. We are finally near the edge of the webs. As we leave the edge of the webs, the goblins tell us they want to come with us. They are having fun with all this action and would like it to continue (I guess they’ll a little twisted, but I shouldn’t be surprised, given their occupation). They are friendly and helpful so there is no dissagreement and welcome them as set out away from the webs. As we travel on our way we go through various tunnels and caverns. We come to one large cavern that has a rickety bridge over a deep casm. After that we go through a tunnel and come out of it to the sounds of comotion. There are lanters and an obelisk, similar to the one we saw before. About 60 feet away there is a rest-stop of sorts with tents and stalls with items laid out. Various denizens of the underdark are shopping in the market. There are 3 tents with 4 stalls selling a wide variety of basic goods. Tools, artwork, musical instruments, and simple weapons. Many of the items are made from a dark purple wood called zirkwood that is prevelant in the underdark. Behind one of the tents is an deep-gnome cooking and serving some kind of soup or stew at a camp fire. There are 8 blue/red giant lizards just resting nearby. They don’t look friendly but they don’t look overly hostile either. Dezo goes to get a closer look at the lizards but they don’t seem to like him and a gnome shooes him away. Yuk Yuk offers to open to the small lock box so we can see what the Mimic was carrying. We go a bit out of the way to inspect the box. Inside the acid eaten wooden box is a metalic box that Yuk Yuk manages to get open. Inside is a slim metal bracelet with a an inset light blue crystal. It is cool to the touch and almost certainly magical. Dezo decides to spend some time studying the bracelet while the rest of us do some shopping or browsing. I try to find someone to identify the our small collection of potions while Zahkam looks into buying an instrument. There are 5 deep gnomes running the various stalls and a handful of other patrons: a few drow; a couple under-dwarves; and an odd-looking individual on the outskirts than keeps coming in and looking at a stall or two and then walking out. He seems uneasy. I approach him and on closer inspection guess that he is a mix of halfling and dwarf, but I could be wrong. He looks quite old and has a patchy beard and uneven mustache. When I approach him I can’t understand what he says. I try common and goblin but he doesn’t understand either. He appears to cast a spell and suddenly we can understand each other. I ask him what he’s doing and he says it’s none of my business and asks what I’m doing. I say I’m trying to identify some potions and he says he can do it for 100 gold peices per potion. I try to barter him down to 100 GP for two potions but he is stubborn. I try offering a trade of services, inquiring if he needs help with anything. This seems to make him nervous. He pulls me close and whispers “This isn’t a goo place to talk. I’ve been following these drow. They have my family. I want to get them back, but not here, we need to follow them back to their base”. He says he’ll identify anything I want if I help him save his family. I need to talk to the group about this so tell him I have an answer shortly. He tells me to hurry. Verril, Zahkam, Dezo, Yuk Yuk, and Spider Bait are in favour of helping the weird geezer. Only Neznar is against it. We didn’t ask Fargas or Boopido their opinion. Fargas wants us to go after the treasure but doesn’t have much choice so agrees to come along. As we’re discussing this the drow start to leave the bazaar. We quickly decide to just leave Boopido behind, quickly telling him this as we go and he seems fine with it. We catch up to the old fella, find out his name is Errug, and start following the drow on the sly. We follow them for a while before we hear the sound of rushing water - another underground river. We begin to see a sickly green glow as we approach the oppening of a tunnel and the sound of the water get louder. The tunnel opens up to a large cavern with a river going through it. On the other side of the river about 100 feet from us is a camp with 3 large tents. The cavern is light by large (human sized) mushrooms that give of the green light we’ve been seeing. We decide on a full frontal stealth attack. We need to get accross the river quietly for this to work but Zahkam trips and lets out a yelp, alerting the drow. I think Zahkam is even more clumsy than me. Verril and Dezo jump across the river to engage the drow, with Neznar and Gilberto following close begind. The rest of us (myself, Zahkam, Yuk Yuk, Spider Bait, and Fargas) stay on the far side of the river and launch projectiles. We should have been able to overpower them quickly, but the drow cast darkness, making us on the far side of the river almost useless, drawing out the battle. We still win without any casualties and with two prisoner drow who surrendered. Verill does some looting of the corpses and finds some gold, shortswords, hand crossbows, and 2 arcane staffs. There’s no sign of Errug’s family, but he doesn’t seem to be looking. He just uses some magic to execute the captured drow. That sneaky old goat. There was no family, this was just a personal vendetta. It’s annoying to be tricked, but the drow probably deserved it so I’m not too torn up about it. The pretense was false but we still had a bargain so I ask Errug to identify our potions and Verril’s crystal. The 3 red potions are for healing, as we expected, and the other is a potion of water breathing. I’m not sure how that will help us but we might as well keep it around just in case. He tels us that Verril’s crystal is a natural forming crystal used for for distractions and such, since it makes a small explosion and bright flash when broken. He demonstrated by throwing Verril’s crystal on the ground, releasing a bright flash and loud bang. In the confusion and disorientation of the falsh and bang Errug runs away. When we regain our sight and hearing he is gone without a trace. There are two small pieces of the crystal left that could still be used for that same purpose and Verril takes them. Errug tricked us again but it wasn’t really malevolent, he was probably just worried that we were mad about him lying. This was a bit of a waste of time, but oh well. No real harm done so let’s just move on. Fargas reminds us about his hidden treasure and he shows us his secret map - the item he had been worried was missing when we first found him. He also gives us the back story about how he was looking for the lost tomb when he made his way to the Silken Path and hired Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait’s services and then got taken by the spiders after his friends were killed by them. Map might be a bit of stretch for what he showed us. ‘Cryptic rough semi-guide riddle’ is a better description. The notes on it are written in dwarvish so Gilberto translates for us. There are some rouch drawings that I suppose represent the ‘marks’. As long as I don’t have to lead us it’s fine, cause it doesn’t make much sense to me, but I’ve never been a map guy. The ‘map’ says: Downwards from the Yawning Portal You will find your first mark Downwards still to the cavern of crystals Walk away from the sounds of running water Stop before the petrified forest Find a way downward that is not the one you’ve travelled Walk until your second mark Steel yourself for the path of silk Traverse until the third mark and begin to head upwards Find the titan and traverse it Beware its contents Exit upwards and climb until you can no longer If you have reached the Maw, turn back Head leftwards until the way narrows Upwards until the path opens If your spine is tingling it is too late for you Walk upwards until you reach the hollow mountain Descend into the Tomb of Khaem Light the way onto Dawn After we this discussion we decide to get some rest and set out in the morning. I agree to be tied up for the night on the off chance that I am comitting the murders in my sleep. I’m sure it’s not me, but I’m happy to be tied up if it will makes the others feel better. "],["entry-6-to-kill-a-murderer.html", "Entry 6 - To kill a murderer", " Entry 6 - To kill a murderer 2020/04/18 Zahkam ties me up as we preapre to rest. Just to be safe, I try to escape my bonds and somehow get out almost easily. Escaping this type of bondage is not my specialty, so I don’t know what Zahkam was doing. If I didn’t know Zahkam I would think he wanted my bonds to be loose for some nefarious purpose. But since I do know him, I’m sure he just accidentally messed up on the knots. He’s a great guy, but he tends to bumble seemingly simple things from time to time. As a fellow bumbler, I feel a kinship with him… but will continue to double check his knots. Yuk Yuk and Gilberto redo the knots and tie me much more securely. I can barely move a muscle. I might not get the best sleep, but I certainly won’t be killing anyone. Before we settle down to sleep, Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait ask to join our mission to the tomb as guides. They again want 10 gold pieces per day for their services as under dark experts and for their assistance in battle. This is of course on top of their share of the loot. They give us the night to think about it. After they go to their claimed tent we have a brief discussion and agree that the extra manpower and knowledge of the area will be useful. We take stock of our finances and decide we can easily afford their service and we will likely find more wealth at the tomb so we agree to hire them in the morning. As we settle in for sleep, Dezo takes the first watch, with Gilberto and then Zahkam planned to follow. It isn’t easy falling asleep in these vice-like ropes, but I manage it. As I drift off I suddenly feel awake and very warm. My extremeties heat up to the point of pain. It’s all balck around me as I stand up and smoke is coming from my boots, which feel like they’re on fire. I feel a familiar presence behind me and hear my patron’s voice: “You are the most abysmal servant I’ve ever had. You had very simple instructions and have failed to carry any of them out. You’ve been bested by that ‘gnome’. The gnome has been taking what I wanted. Kill him or I will devour your soul. You have one day.” Or something like that. I can’t remember exactly. I was so suprised to hear him tell me straight out that it was Boopido all along! My patron is maaaad. I’m not sure if it’s more mad at me or Boopido, but at least I have a way to get back in their good books. (Is that a good thing? Do I want to be in the ‘good books’ of a demon?) I awake unsure how much time has passed but decide to let everyone get a full rest before breaking the news. If we’re going to go after him we’ll need to be well rested. Zahkam wakes everyone up and unties me. I call everyone over for a conference around the breakfast fire. I tell them about my dream and that I’m going after Boopido and would like their help, although they don’t have to come, since it isn’t their soul on the line. Gilberto, Dezo, Zahkam, Verril, and Neznar are obviously keen to get revenge on the little bastard for murdering our companions while mooching off of us. It’s pretty obvious that Boopido did unhook our ropes when Dorn and I fell that time when Prince Darrendil died. The little shit. Fargas isn’t happy about the side trip but obviously has little choice. Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait are happy to join us - for their fee, which I happily pay. After breakfast we set off to return to the market at the obelisk to find Boopido and kill him. After a couple hours of walking we get to a familar tunnel near the market. We can hear the sound of animals breathing/hissing and the pattering of feet. We turn a corner to some stairs leading down and come almost face to face with four of the giant lizards we saw at the market earlier. Verril and Neznar are at the front and draw their swords. Dezo yells “Stop! We don’t need to fight!” and shapeshifts into a giant lizard. He isn’t quick enough to stop them and Verril and Neznar start cutting into the two lizards at the front. The rest of us heed Dezo’s words and don’t fight. I try to stop one of the lizards by blasting some magic above it’s head and it kind of sort of almost works… the lizard changes course, I don’t know what I really expected, but it doesn’t attack me. Verril and Neznar stop their attacks and the lizards flee. Before they get away Dezo notices the body of deep gnome being dragged by the saddle straps of one of the lizards. He snaps at the straps as the lizard flees and the body falls to the ground and lays still. The gnome is dead. It looks like he was tortured before dying. The killing blow seems to be the fist sized hole in his back roughly where his heart should be. He appears to be one of the gnomes that was manning a stall in the market. We continue on with Dezo taking the lead in lizard form. When we reach the market we see a lot of blood and bodies. There are bodies staked to the walls, there is a circle with body parts arrayed in a pattern that reminds me of the night murders we’ve been victim too. I didn’t doubt my wise benelovent patron (does he read my journal?) but if any of the others doubted my story, this will likely convince them. From a pile of a couple of lizards we see a hand push through and a cut up body follow. It’s another gnome, the one that shooed Dezo away when he tried to get close to the lizards. He is injured but alive. He thinks Dezo is one of his pets and is talking to him and giving him weird looks. Dezo circles around him to get some Stoop spores on him so we can communicate. This confuses the gnome since it still thinks Dezo is his pet. We approach the gnome and ask him what happened. He asks why we left “that creature” here. Apparently Boopido asked for shelter and the gnomes acoomodated him but during the night this gnome woke up to the sounds of a masacre. Boopido had transformed into a large black creature with big claws and magical powers. He killed everyone. This gnome survived by being hit with some magic that didn’t kill him and then having some lizards die on top of him which kept him hidden. He breaks into tears as he tells us about what he saw and heard. Verril searches the area for useful items while Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait look for a clues about where Boopido went. Verril finds some money and I take a nice wand to use as a focus. The goblins find Boopido’s trail and we set out after it. I overhear Fargas mumblin to himself as he looks at his map at it appears we’re going in the right direction for the tomb too. That’s nice at least, we won’t have to backtrack after killing Boopido. We walk for about 2 hours, mostly going up. It gets warmer and the scenery is constantly changing. Always caverns and tunnels, but the look and feel of them changes frequently. We come to a clearing full of vegetation - some kind of green moss or lichen - and ahead is a violet haze in the air. The path Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait bring us on includes jumping across a broken archway. I seem to be doing better athletically now that we’re off the Silken Path, but Fargas nearly falls. Neznar and Verril are there to grab him and it’s fine, but then Zahkam jumps. He just barely makes it, but then the edge gives way and he falls. Luckily, he manages to grab hold of the edge before plummeting to his almost certain death, and Neznar and Verril pull him up. Seriously, it feels like at least one of us is always almost falling to our death. The next few hours pass without incident, until we begin to apraoch a large cliff. On our right is a jagged cave wall and on our left is a sheer cliff descending into nothingness. There is still a purple haze in the air without any clear source. The haze stats to give way to big brightly glowing purple crystals, roughly doule the size of a human, jutting out of the ground at various angles. We hear a mad cackle from somewhere ahead of us. Yuk Yuk tells us that we’ve almost caught up. We get in battle formation and prepare for the fight. We give a healing potion each to our melee fighters, Verril, Neznar, and Gilberto. Dezo is behind them and the rest of us take up the rear. I’m a bit nervous because my Fiendish Vigor (temporary health buffer provided by my patron) is weaker than usual. I’m not sure why, but have a suspicious it is because my patron is displeased with me and is witholding some of his power. Unsurprisingly, Verril can’t resist touching one of the crystals. Reality seems to shimmer around him and he vanishes. We hear an excited/panicked yelp about a hundred feet to our left and the mad cackling abruptly stops. Verril starts yelling out “Hey guys? Where are you?”. We hear Boopido call out “I hear you! I know you’ve been following me for a while. I’m excited that we can be together again”, in a creepy voice that seems to echo out of the crystals around us. Boopido, in his deadly form, appears in front of us near one of the crystals. He is close to nine feet tall with smooth black skin and large claws, just like the deep gnome described. For the slow readers out there, the crystals teleport you around this chamber, which is much more usuful for Boopido than it is for us. It is a long and difficult battle. I try using my magic a couple of times but the effect is pretty pathetic and I switch to my crossbow. I’m pretty sure my patron is withholding his power, since I feel fine, it’s just my magic that feels very week. Boopido has powerful ice magic that takes Gilberto and Verril down before the end of it, but Dezo manages to save them. He also uses silence and sleep spells. This is probably why he was able to carry out the murders without anyone noticing. With so many of us shooting crossbows at him, we eventually wear him down and I finally finished him off with a bolt to his throat, cutting off his stupid maniacal laugh once and for all. As he dies the area around him grows very cold and light seems to swirl around his body and then shoot towards me and enter me. I’m given brief visions of the people he’s killed. I see Vawyn and Dorn, but also many, many others. It’s over in an instant but I won’t soon forget the horrible things I saw. "],["entry-7-titan-beetles-im-not-a-fan.html", "Entry 7 - Titan beetles. I’m not a fan", " Entry 7 - Titan beetles. I’m not a fan 2020/05/03 Following the visions of Boopido’s murders I can feel my magical powers have restored to their normal strength. So my soul is safe… for now. I examine Boopido’s body and discover a luminous fog that feels cold coming from within his corpse. I find a blue crystal with purple etching. It’s pulsing and released the cold fog. It has a thin rope tied around it. I’ll save it for later, it’s clearly magical and could be useful. I also found two pouches. One is a small coin purse with some money and gems that I add to our growing collection of wealth. The other bag appeared empty but it’s a magic bag! Anything you put inside dissapears but if you put your hand in and think of an item that in the bag then it will materialize in you hand. It’s a bag of holding! This is an awesome find! I’m sure Verril will find wonderful (*cough* dangerous *cough*) things to fill it with in no time. Gilberto seems to hear something and suddenly there is a crossbow bolt sticking out of Nezanr. A drow attack! The battle is over fairly quickly but Nezanr and Gilberto go down. A drow mage managed to run away as the battle was ending but with two downed comrades we decided to just let him go. Dezo revives Neznar and he drinks his health potion. We almost lost Gilberto but we managed to give him his health potition before he was too far gone to be saved. We decided to leave before the drow mage could return with reinforcements. Our guides led us further on instead of backtracking, which I was glad for as it seemed to be away from the drow… at least, the drow we just fought. As we walk we eventually get away from the purple crystals and their haze. We end up at a crossroads where Yuk-Yuk and Spiderbait talk about going down one of the paths but Neznar pushes them along the other path saying “You don’t want to go that way.” Yuk-Yuk nods dissapointedly. I’m guessing there is something “interesting” the way the golbins wanted to go but also something dangerous. Maybe a few days/weeks ago I would have asked them about that other path and been more curious, but now I just want to get out of the underdark. We spend hours walking, mostly upward. We arrive in a large cavern with aurora like lights near the ceiling. It’s beautiful, and it coincides with the rocky floor being replaced by sand. As we enter the sand area ours ears pop and the hairs on the back of necks stand up. That’s not a great sign. The aurora like lights high up in the cavern swirl around and occasionally collide with each other, release a burst of light and sound. The sounds released range from thunder to the children’s laughter to the sounds of war. Fargas checks his map and claims that this is ‘the titan’ that the map speaks of. Neznar confirms this. The map says “traverse it, beware its contents, exit upwards”. ‘Beware its contents’. Super duper. Yuk-Yuk and Spiderbait lead the way across the sands. Before long, Dezo sees and yells out “There’s something in the sand!”. I try to run to the side but my foot falls into a funnel and something latches onto my leg. I try to get away but can’t get a purchase on anything in the loose sand. Verril runs to solid ground and throws me a rope. He botches the throw and it lands way out of reach. Gilberto runs over to me and pulls me out of the sand funnel. While this was going on, other funnels opened up in the sand nearby. Once I was out of the funnerl the sand stopped sliding down and started coming back out. Then suddenly, large beetles started flowing out of the funnel. I try to blast them with burning hands and I manage to kill dozens of them, but many more keep come flowing out behind the dead ones. After seeing the lack of effect of my most powerful spell, I turn and run. Other swarms start emerging from the various funnels that have opened up. Dezo shoots at a swarm but his bolt has less effect than my magic did. Verril also charges in and swinges his sword at the swarm but that is also innefectual. Verril, Gilberto, and Dezo get enveloped by swarms of beetles. Luckily, they manage to shake of the bugs and get away from the swarms. We all start to run and thankfully the swarms don’t move very quickly. New funnels open up as we run so we can’t let up until we finally see a campfire in the distance. As we approach the fire we see a lone figure next a wagon. There is another wagon half buried in the sand. As we get closer we see that the lone figure is a duergar (underdark dwarf) on an area of solid ground. The duergar is talking to himself and there are fresh skeletons near the edge of the solid ground. They look like they’ve been picked clean by bugs as they were trying to reach the safety of this area. We see an empty steeder shell (the duergar beasts of burden that Yuk-Yuk pointed out to us back on the Silken Path). We all gather together on the solid ground and it seems safe enough. Shortly after arriving we hear a muffled scream from one of the wagons. The duergar mumbles and goes over to the wagon and bangs on it. He takes a sphere and does something to to it so it begins to smoke. He opens a hatch in the wagon and tosses the smoking sphere into it. We hear coughing and smoke starts to seep out of the seems in the wagon. We have escaped the beetles for now, but what have we stepped into now? "],["entry-8-slavers-beware.html", "Entry 8 - Slavers, beware", " Entry 8 - Slavers, beware 2020/06/27 I approach the Duargar, who doens’t seem to have noticed us. I speak to him and wave my hand in front of him but he still doens’t notice me. Not a great sign. As I get right next to him and he still doesn’t see me I decide to poke him in the shoulder to get his attention. He gaze shifts to me immediately and he looks me straight in the eye, grabs my wrist and starts yelling in my face in a language I don’t understand. His breathe reeks of death and decay. his face is heavily scarred and he is mising an eye. I just stare back as he yells and this seems to upset him because he then grabs my collar and pulls me closer and starts yelling again. I try to get out of his grip but he’s much stronger than me. This was a really dumb idea. I should have just use Mage Hand from a distance to get his attention. Typically Vernon. Verril comes to help me get away from the Duargar has a really good grip on me. I manage to cast Mage Hand (better late than never) and give his hair a little tug from behind to hopefully distract him. He saw me casting and felt the hand behind him but when he looked he didn’t see anything. This spooked him enough to get him to let me go and run off and hide behind a nearby pillar. We all start to surround his position but I tell everyone to wait for a minute while I try to calm him down with my telephathy by letting him know we don’t mean him harm. This works and he calms down enough for Dezo to bring over Stoop to give him some spores. Now that communication is possible, Verril asks him who he, what he’s doing here, etc. The Duargar is all that’s left of a slave catching mission and there is only one slave left. He’s been eating to slaves to stay alive. The remaining slave was traded for with some Drow, but no more is known about him. This doesn’t sit well with us so Verril get’s a tour of the camp while the rest of us have a telepathic conversation via Stoop. We decide to try to capture him, but if that’s not possible, kill him, and then free the prisoner. We decide to have everyone get close to him and then I’ll cast Command to make him lie down so we can easily jump on him and tie him up. My spells works (surprisingly…) and Verril jumps on him to tie him up. The Duargar struggles like crazy so I jump in there and help. Together we get him securely tied up. While that was going on, Gilberto was picking the lock to free the prisoner. The prisoner is Iankul, a tall, frail looking, male, elf. With the prisoner freed and the salver in the cage, we searched the ‘camp’ and found a decent amount of stuff. LOTS of money, a light blue bubbling potion, fancy old looking scrolls that we can’t read, and long thin sword in a silver scabbard with a bird of prey hilt. We also find two of those smoke-bomb things the slaver threw into the wagon/cage. We’ll have to investigate the value of these items, but they are interesting! The Duargar is securely tied up and it’s been a long stretch of excitement and exersion so we decide to have a rest before interogating the prisoner and deciding what to do with him. My vote is to leave him tied up and throw him into the sand in the opposite direction of where we want to go in order to distract some of those damn beetles. That’s pretty cold and heartless, but he’s a slaver who’s been eating his prisoners, so I don’t feel bad about it, at all. Verril takes first watch and I agree to take second. I woke up for my watch thinking how nice it was that we didn’t need to worry about anyone killing us in our sleep anymore… Shortly after my watch begins the Duargar started laughing hysterically and continued for about a minute and then abruptly stopped. I went over to the cage to see what’s going on and he’s just rocking back and forth while grunting/growling. Once he notices me at the door he violently tries to escape his bonds and get to me. While this was happening, Verril had supposedly woken up possesed and attacked Neznar and Zackham. Verril can be a bit of a dummy but there’s no way he’d do this in his right mind. I yell to wake everyone up and cast Command on Verril to make him lie down. It works (wow! two in a row!) and I jump on him to try to restrain him. Unsurprisingly, I’m unable to overpower him. Luckily, I’ve slowed him down enough to give others time to come help me. When Iankul woke up, presumably very surprised and confused, he healed Zahkam so regained conciousness and cast a lauhter spell on Verril which allowed me to keep him constrained until the golbins and Gilberto could come help me try to tie him up. I somehow noticed during the scuffle that Iankul chose to heal Zakham furhter, but left Neznar bleeding and unconscious on the ground. Was this deliberate or did he just not see Neznar? If I’m being honest, I can’t blame Iankul if he chose to just let Neznar die. After all, he was captured by the Drow and then sold to the Duargar and was waiting to be eaten, so a little grudge against Drow is perfectly understandable. How long did it take us to stop constantly thinking Neznar was trying to trick or kill us? We finally get Verril securely tied up but the whole time we were doing that the Duargar was trying to escape. He had gotten free of his bonds and had been smashing himself against the door with seemingly super-duargar strength. He managed to break the door but as he came out Dezo cast a paralyzing spell on him and he just fell to the ground. We unanimously decided (did we even say anything or did we just all move together?) that the Duargar should just be killed right away before he could cause anymore trouble. So we quickly slaughtered him and then went back to deal with Verril, who was still struggly furiously against his ropes. "],["entry-9-a-new-friend.html", "Entry 9 - A new friend!", " Entry 9 - A new friend! 2020/07/13 As Verril continued to struggle against his ropes he began to loosen them so I grabbed some of the salver chains that were lying about and run to use them on him but just before I reach him he manages to get an arm free and grabs me. The chains are more just hanging on him than containing him. He makes good use of my blunder and grabs the chain and whips them around like a… whip and solidly hits me in the head. What iron-y heh heh heh. Everyone then joins together (except Neznar, they weren’t able to save him) and we finally get Verril tightly secured with the chains. During the scuffle I noticed a ring on Verril’s finger that I don’t remember seeing before. I find this intriguing so I attempt to sneak it off his finger with Mage Hand but as soon as it starts to move he gets a panicked looked in his eyes and makes a tight fist to keep the ring on. I try to force it off but my Mage Hand is no match for his real hand. Yuk-Yuk gets fed up with this silly contest and jumps on Verril and starts bashing him in the head with the pommel of his dagger. This works wonderfully and Verril loses consciousness. As he does I yank off the ring. Verril comes to pretty quickly and the change in his behaviour is immediate. He is appologizing profusely and clearly feels terrible about trying to kill us all. He doens’t specifically mention hitting me in the head with a chain, but I’ll let it slide. Apparently he was conscious for all of it but was just a passenger in his body without any control. Some entity was controlling him and it’s obviously tied to the ring somehow. Verril has no idea how or where he got the ring or how/when it got on his finger. While we talk about I keep holding it in my Mage Hand because I’m hesitant to touch it. After some discussion we decide to just throw the ring into the sand as far as possible. It’s potentially very valuable (even though it looks old and shabby) and is clearly very powerful, but we are hesitant to carry it around until we can have it properly studied. We’ve had enough nighttime murders to last us at least a month before we invite more of that nonsense into our lives. So decide to play it safe by going back to bed before setting out into the death desert of killer beetles… I take first watch with Dezo (just in case the ring comes back or… something). I realize I never checked all the contents of Boopido’s bag of holding that I took from him. I turn it inside out to have all the contents fall out and I almost immediately regret it. Nothing but eyeballs. Several different species, all discustingly fresh and wet and squishy, piling up at my feet until finally that cold crystal plops on top of them. I brush off the crystal and put it bag in the bag and just leave the eyebals where they are. I also feel better about killing Boopido. Not that I needed any more reasons (I’m still haunted by the visions I saw after his death) but who collects eyeballs? That’s just weird. Oh well, I freed up some space (I know it’s negligible) and also learned that things kept in the bag stay fresh for longer than normal. If I didn’t know better I would have thought those eyes had been removed from at most a few minutes ago. My watch ends without incident and head to bed. A few minutes before I wake up I get a visit from my patron. Apparently it’s happy with me at the moment and has bestowed upon me a familiar! Of course, it doesn’t say it’s giving me a familiar, it just says it’s happy with me (and makes it clear that that can easily change) and is giving me a gift. After the communication ends I feel claws land on chest and walk across me. This is of course terriffying at first but the gentleness of the contact makes it clear that it isn’t going to harm me. As I calm down I notice a new presence in my mind, it’s Xaphan the imp! I’m sure we’ll be buddies in no time. As I start to become fully awake he walks off, invisible, into the darkness. Once we all get up I have everyone shows their hands just to make sure the ring didn’t do any funny business. Everyone’s hands are ring free which is a good start. Yuk-Yuk also things he saw the way out when one of those Aurora flash things went off a few hundred feet away. He says there is a platform or something that might have be the way out. I let everyone know about my new familiar and we decide to send it as a scout first with me looking through it’s eyes. There is nothing much between us and the platform except sand and some pillars so we set off. I have Xaphan keep looking ahead and to report back if he find the actual exit or anything dangerous. As we walk, unsurprisingly, I step into another beetle pit. I’m in the lead because I know where to go since I saw the way through Xaphan’s eyes, but he was flying, not walking. Verril tries to pull me out but ends up also falling in. We’re thrown some rope and pulled out and luckily, no beetle swarms attack us. A few beetles come out but then just go back in. Someone, (Dezo I think?) has the genious idea of tying us all together so if anyone steps in a hole we can pull them out quickly. When I say ‘anyone’, I of course mean me. I step in two more holes before we make it to the pillar with the platform. Verril yanks me out of them before I get stuck in them, thankfully, but beetles swarms come out of them and we can hear a loud deep noise behind us as if something large is following us. This makes us want to go faster, and is part of why I stepped in those stupid holes. That and the fact that I have two people in my head and I’m not used to it so I was a bit distracted. By the time we get to the pillar Yuk-Yuk has some beetles on his heels but is doing ok but Gilberto is in pretty rough shape from one of them. Along with the familiar, I also learned a new spell from my patron called Spider Climb which is perfect right now. I can run up the pillar with the rope and tie it off so everyone else can climb it and get up to the platform so we can get out of this death desert. I yell at everyone to untie themselves from the rope and come around to the far side of the pillar away from the beetles. Hopefully we can all make it out of here. "],["entry-10-worms-are-gross.html", "Entry 10 - Worms are gross", " Entry 10 - Worms are gross 2020/07/20 Once I detach myself from the rope I cast Spider Climb and start walking up the pillar with ease (a nice change for me). Dezo turns into a giant lizard and scrambles up ahead of me. Zackaham also makes a good start of climbing the pillar. My intention is to tie a rope above so those below can more easily scale the sheer face of the pillar without falling to their death. As I’m walking up Xaphan tells me there is something large moving towards us under the sand. Before I make it very far up the beetle swarm that had been after Yuk-Yuk catches up to him and engulfes him. They really go at him seem to be ripping him apart. Spider-Bait screams and tries to pull Yuk-Yuk out of the swarm to drag him away from the beetles. This seems to work but Yuk-Yuk is unconcious and doesn’t look to be in good shape. As the last of us reaches the base of the pillar a giant sand-worm-thing burst out of the ground. It has hundred of tiny feet, two big eyes and tenatacles coming out of its face. The worm hits Fargas and bites into Iankul, trying to devour him. Zahkam reaches halfway up the approximately 100 foot tall pillar, which is hourglass-ish shaped, and throws a rope down for Spider-Bait to tie to Yuk-Yuk he can be pulled up. When I get to the top I tie my rope around a rock and have Xaphan bring the other end down to Zackham to tie them together. I’ve only have 30 seconds experience using Spider Climb at this point but have already forgotten most people need their hands to climb vertical rock. Unsurprisingly, Zackham has trouble staying on the wall while trying to tie two ropes together and he almost falls. I tell Xaphan to tie the ropes together but I didn’t think to ask him how good he was with tying knots. Apparently, he isn’t great, because as soon as he let the ropes go they just fell apart. Luckily, no-one was hanging from it yet. Xaphan races after the falling rope and I head down to do the tying myself once he retrieves it since a) I can use both hands without fear of falling, and b) I know how to tie knots. While I walk down I hear what sounds like Gilberto falling off the pillar on the other side. It sounds painful but like something he’ll be able to walk off. Around the same time, Spider-Bait throwns something that made a big blast and seemed to distort space and make the worm implode for a moment before re-expanding. It looks like it did a lot of damage. I remember I have those smoke bomb things from the duargar and take one out to maybe stun the worm with. However, I think about how accurate my throwing arm is and the fact that the smoke will likely hit my comprades whether my aim is good or not, and decide against it and just unleash some magic. It feels weird aiming from a horizontal position and most of my attacks miss but I do make at least one solid hit. Others are attacking the beast and it eventually has enough and runs (swims? slimes? squirms?) away. We get the ropes tied and everyone makes it up to the platform. Gilberto, Yuk-Yuk, and Iankul are all pretty hurt but they’ll live. We decide to have a short rest to heal up before moving on. The cave ahead of us forks in two direction so I send Xaphan down the left path while Dezo, who doesn’t need to heal, explores the other. While we rest I examine the nice sword that we found at the duargar camp. It turns out it’s Iankul’s sword, and it’s pretty awesome. I return it to him and we wait for the scouts to return. Dezo was attacked by some blood sucking bugs but they just wanted a drink, not to kill him, so they left after a short meal. That was enough for him though, so he returned after that. Xaphan had better luck and found some collapsed ceilings that resulted in a tunnel leading up that ends in a large cavern. It would be a tight fit but we should all make it. At camp Fargas and the goblins seem to have bonded a bit. Fargas had thrown a special ointment to Spider-Bait when Yuk-Yuk got hurt, which was very well received. Silly Spider_bait left the jar at the bottom of the pillar though, and it has sentimental value to Fargas so I had Xaphan go get it. The injured still hurt, but they can move, so we continue on our way. It is slow moving through the tunnel in the collapsed ceilings. While we’re going the ground starts to rumble and gradually increases into what feels like a serious earthquake. We frantically scramble out of the tunnel into the large cavern Xaphan had found. The cavern is dark and damp and we can hear dripping water in the distance. Before we have a chance to explore there is another earthquake, even stronger this time. It it so violent that stalactites fall from the ceiling and we are bounced around between the stalagmites. This lasts about 5 minutes and we are a bit worse for wear once it finally subsides. I notice that instead of water dripping, I hear water rushing. "],["entry-11-tentacles-are-gross.html", "Entry 11 - Tentacles are gross", " Entry 11 - Tentacles are gross 2020/08/03 As we regain our bearings and composure after the earthquake, we hear more joyous noises: large wings flapping in the distance accompanied by some kind of whooping or hooting sound. We decided to send my familiar ahead to scout since he can fly and be invisible, I thought he’d be fairly safe. I was wrong. It isn’t long before I lose my connection with him, which means he’s been killed. Luckily, he’s not really dead, he just dissapears and goes… somewhere to wait to be summoned again. That doesn’t help us in our current situation though. I report to the group that my familiar has almost definitely been killed and by something he didn’t see coming. We prepare for a battle and head out in the direction of my last contact with Xaphan. When we get to the area of Xaphan’s death we hear the whoot/hoot sound again but it’s coming form above us. We look up and see a gross tentacle-thing on the ceiling. Dezo throws his flame at it as it tried to descend onto SpiderBait. A battle ensues with three of these spikey-tentacled grossies and we come out victorious but Iankul is pretty hurt. He had one all over him for a bit trying to eat him. It sounds like there are more in the distance but they don’t seem to move around all that much so we take a moment to patch up Iankul before setting off very carefully. It’s too bad caution doesn’t let you avoid earthquakes. There is another one and we get bounced around pretty hard again. This further opens up the moving water we heard and we discover an underground river. Verril investigates it for bathing purposes and takes a bath while we watch with both marvel trepidation. At least he tied a rope to himself to make sure he doesn’t drown or get swept away. I guess he’s learning. Miraculously, nothing realy happens during his bath and once he’s done we decide to cross the river. The river is about 10 feet across, which most people can handle jumping but with my track record I decide to ride on Verril’s back while he jumps. This is after he literally throws the goblins and halfling across, to my heartfelt amusement. After crossing we climb up a crevice/shaft that leads to a tunnel and reach a nice little cave pocket that has a cozy feel to it so we decide to take a nice break and recover from our recent ordeals. I take this time to investigate the cold blue crystal I got from Boopido. Turns out it’s the tooth of a large powerful beast that was killed long ago. It has magical properties that let me get the most out of some of my spells and can act as a focus for my spells. Giant beast tooth is definitely cooler than my wand. Before go to sleep the goblins let us know that they are going to be leaving us soon. We attract a bit too much danger for their liking. I said earlier that maybe Verril is learning, but dang he needs to work on his people skills. He says some weird stuff about the goblins being sketchy but he didn’t bother being secret about it so the goblins heard it all and things got really awkward for a bit. I don’t think any feelings were hurt though, they have been travelling with Verril for a while. After our rest we head out towards a reddish light further down the tunnel. As we go we start to see familiar underdark type flora that are bioluminescent (the source of the red glow). We come to a fork in the path, unsure which way to go. "],["entry-12-did-you-know-mushrooms-can-scream.html", "Entry 12 - Did you know mushrooms can scream?", " Entry 12 - Did you know mushrooms can scream? 2020/08/10 By the time we get to the fork the ground has changed a bit. There is soft stone with dirt and some small plants and mushrooms - the goblins say we are in the “upper-underdark”. We continue walking and until we get a fork with three paths. Yuk-Yuk seems to think he and Spiderbait have been here before. I get a sense of unbridled joy and excitement creepimg up and becoming overwhelming for a brief moment. I hear in my mind (along with the rest of the group) “We’re near, I can feel it”. It’s Stoop, letting us know we’re getting close and that he wants to take the path to the right. He wants to find a grove so he can communicate with the mycanids and find out how to get to Neverlight Grove. We have no reason to go any other way so we take the path Stoop suggested. As we walk we hear the chitering of a bat (bat-ish?) swarm above us. We didn’t think they were a risk but they suddenly swooped down and attacked those in the front. Verril and Dezo got the worst of it and the creatures were easily scared off, or maybe they just had their fill of fresh flesh and were done with us. They disperse and we hurry along the natural slope we’ve been following. We end up in a cave witjh glowing purple stone in them and other colours coming from…. where did all those colours come from? Plants? Stones? I don’t remember, but it was colourful. We all feel euphoric again ans Stoop excitedly tells us “this is it!”. Dezo takes out Stoop and walks around the cave, Zacham and I follow him while Verril investigates a skull on the ground. We suddenly hear a sucking sound and then a deep silence followed by an ear splitting scream released some of the mushrooms. Stoop doesn’t like the sound either and says he’s never heard it before. Dezo uses a spell to dump a 5-foot cube of dirt onto the screaming mushrooms, twice. This muffles the sound and we continue on. There is another screaming muchroom and Dezo covers it like th last one but we also start to hear a screeching from a beast or group of beasts nearby. We are attacked by three beaked worms with 4 spiked tentacles coming out of their “faces”. One got right in my face by Zackham sent it running with a spell, giving me some space to cast my own spells. In the darkness (that’s my excuse anyway…) I have trouble hitting anything. I send streaks of energy glying all over the place but most them miss, by a lot. Story of my life. I’d be long dead if I had to fight on my own. No thanks to me, we win the battle and everyone is alive but Verril and Spiderbait are pretty hurt. Verril had almost died but Zackham used the same spell he saved me with and sent it running, which gave Verril and opportunity to finish it off. Unfortunately, Verril was in such a rage that he charged at the last one and finished it off too, despite his wounds, ending the battle. That really make me feel useless. We don’t hear anymore of the worms and the mushrooms are silent so we get a sense of security (silly us). Stoop gets excited again and we follow Dezo as he caries Stoop to the center of the cave and Stoop has us set him down. Dezo “plants” him in a small hole and the unbridled joy we’re experiencing through Stoop intensifies and fills us to the brim with euphoria. Stoop tells is he feels great and that he “can feel everyone”. "],["entry-13-goodbye-goblins.html", "Entry 13 - Goodbye goblins", " Entry 13 - Goodbye goblins 2020/08/17 Stoop says he needs about a cycle (~6 hours) to do what he needs to do. We take a nice long rest. I take first watch and decide to investigate some of our loot. I take the blue fizzy potion and give it all my attention… I mean, I give it some of my attention while still keeping vigilant in my watch duties. The potion smells sour/fermented. I dip my finger in for a taste. It’s very sweet and lemon-y. It gives me a feeling of invigoration. After a bit more careful stufy I determine it’s a potion of heroism! Great find. I hear some chittering that transitions into hisses and growls. I also hear muffled sounds from the covered mushrooms. Uh oh. The creatures sound a ways off though, so I wake Verril, give him the potion since it will be most useful to him, and go to sleep. He’ll keep us safe. I am woken later by a strong breeze. Stoop is now about 4 feet tall with arms and legs and a face-ish thing with 6 eyes and big mushroom cap that emanates a faint teal-blue light around him. Dezo is talking to him. Apparently Stoop sucked the life out of the save’s mushrooms and produced a slightly poisonous fog. Dezo woke us so we could move away for safety’s sake as we finish our rest. Stoop addresses us and seems his usual self, he just got a lot bigger and can walk around on his own now. After everyone is rested up Yuk-Yuk and Spiderbait let us know they will be parting ways from us since this is an area they are familiar with. They were a good couple of golbins. I never made us of the goblin tongue with them. We could have been laughing at the others right in front of their faces or shits and giggles, oh well. I happily give them their share of our money (2/7) and wish them well on their travels. We set off following Stoop for several hours with lots of tunnels and turns. We get feelings of being “nudged” by Stoop as we go. It makes it nice, not having to worry about the direction we’re going in. We are led into a canyon and gets very tight at one point but we trust Stoop and continue on. It eventually starts to get warm and damp as the path widens and we can hear dripping ahead. As we continue we see signs of vegetation, a river, and out of nowhere, two drow standing perfectly still just staring at us from about 20 feet away! This is a bit shocking but they don’t seem to care about us. They don’t respond when I pat them on the face with Mage Hand or when I try to communicate with my limited telepathy. Zackham goes up to them to investigate but Dezo and I warn him to be careful and investigate the surrounding area. We don’t find anything of interest but Stoop tells us they are sentinels of the mycanids. That people can be turned into “sentinels” troubles me a bit since it seems we’re walking into the sentinel-making-haven. I ask Stoop if he would help keep us non-sentineled and he says he would argue against us be turned into sentinels once we reach Neverlight Grove. He just got his legs a few hours ago so I don’t know how much “argue power” he has, but at least he’s on our side. We cross a small river and come accross a mushroom do “something” (I didn’t quite see) and let out a cloud of smoke. We can hear weird voices and Dezo asks Stoop if this is a friend or foe but the mushroom responds for itself and says in our minds, “friend”. "],["entry-14-neverlight-grove.html", "Entry 14 - Neverlight Grove", " Entry 14 - Neverlight Grove 2020/08/26 This new mycanid is named Breberil and informs that we’re almost at Neverlight Grove! Woot Woot! We made it! Breberil thanks us for bringing Stoop here and invites us to meet Sovereign Phylo. We are led through fields of mushrooms and see some of those big beats Prince Darendill was transformed into (I forget what they’re called). These are motionless like the drow we saw so presumably are more “sentinels”. We reach what seems like the entrance and I notice that everything I can see is alive. Almost everything is a mushroom or some other kind of fungus, but still alive. We walk up a slope tand have a good vantage to view the area. There is a tall (100~200ft) tower, a ‘forest’ of mushrooms,and a valley leading to the forest, which is where we go. We learn that mycanids are normally nomadic but they have found a good home here. THey have been ruled/governed/led by sovereign Phylo for a while but recently sovereign Basidia arrived with another group. We arrive at a group of mycanids standing around a key figure at the centre. They all stand completely still and silent since they communicate… sporally? so it is eerily quiet. Berebril tells us to approach the the group to meet to two sovereigns. They “spore” us (can spore be used as a verb?) and we begin to hear their voices in our heads. Soveriegn Phylo invites us to “join in the celebration” and Zackham starts playing a tune. We feel various emotions pass through us: joy, confusion, and others. I suppose we are feeling what the mycanids around us are feeling? From the confusion I conclude that they don’t get many troubadours spontaneously breaking into song. After Zackham finishes Phylo tells us that we have free access to all of the lower plateau but asks that we don’t go to the upper levels. He thanks us for bringing Stoop but is unable to help us get back to the surface. We hear another voice tell us that they don’t know how to get to the surface either but they offer to guide us around the grove. This is sovereign Basidia. We feel a sense of caution, urgency, and uncertainty. Basidia dishes out the mycanid gossip. She tells us that sovereign Phylo has invited people in like we were but they haven’t been seen since. Sovereign Phylo is talking up some “Great Seeder” that is an unknown entity to Basidia and it worries her. Basidia thinks Phylo has fallen victom to some disease or malicious spore. Their relationship was better in the past but she has been gradually sidestepped in governing and Phylo is changing the way things are done in a disturbing fashion. I don’t really get it all, but Basidia seems legit and trustworthy so we’ve agreed to help her out. She wants us to find out what’s going on with Phylo. Basidia brings us to the “Circle of Hunters” and introduces us to Loobamud, the leader of the circle. He asks us to help with the extermination of a couple creatures that have been causing problems. The hunters don’t kill things, they just harvest corpses, which is why they need out help. There is a swamp monster and a cave monster. The swamp monster is some kind of plant-beast and is a more immediate threat because of it’s proximity to the grove. The cave monster is some kind of giant worm thing. I ask Basidia if they have any equipment we might be able to use to help us and she brings a bunch of ‘junk’ with a few nice trinkets mixed in. What’s really nice though, is she has everything I need to resummon Xaphan! There are also some scrolls and a couple gourds with healing potion in them.

There is a moment of silence, then a low growl, followed by a caucophany of screeches. We are attacked by spiky-tentacled worm-things like we faught in that cave with the screeming mushrooms. Zackham had made a remark about my aim with my spells but my first attack on one of the worms was a powerful shot directly in its ‘face’ and its whole head just exploded. Stupidly, I gloated a bit. I say stupidly, because I hot almost nothing but rock for the rest of the fight. The small worms don’t give us too much trouble but there is a huge one as well, and it’s a bit tougher. I manage to hit it a few times but am still mostly missing. When we think the beast is almost vanquished it grabs Iankul in its mouth and tries to run away. It’s felled by a clutch shot by Zackham before it escapes and Dezo swoops in the heal Iankul before it’s too late.

It’s too big for us to carry back so they decide to wait and guard the corpse while we head back and send more hunters to help them. When we get to the Circle of Hunters there are fewer mycanids around than when we left. Dezo explains to Loobamud the situation with the body and Loobamud expresses dissapointment that we didn’t just bring the whole thing back in one piece, as if it would be that easy! We killed this thing for them for free (basically…) and then they complain we didn’t gift wrap the body for them too? A bit rude I’d say. Lobbamud tells us that Basidia is looking for us but he doesn’t know where she is, but she might be at the Circle of Explorers and points us in the right direction. We head off and when we get there we see mycanids that seem much more “human-like”. They carry tools, wepons and pouches and even address each other with a bit of a head nod, whereas most mycanids make no physical display of communication at all. As we approach the group their leader (I assume) confronts us and asks what we’re doing here. We explain the situation and he relaxes a bit but isn’t overly friendly. He says Basidia isn’t here but will give us a couple guides/guards to bring us to her. As we’re about to leave he says we shouldn’t come back here without Basidia. Dezo asks about if we’re looking for Basidia and he says something along the lines of “yes, you can look for her, but don’t come here without here”. This confuses and bothers Dezo and he questions the logic of this dufus who just repeats himself. This annoys me, and I let my frustration get the better of me. I use Mask of Many Faces to turn myself into Basidia and ask if it’s ok for us to walk around now? This angers and frightens them. They calm down a bit when I change back and I almost immediately regret shwoing my trump card so soon. Oh well. We head off and I consider the event forgiven and forgotten by all…wishful thinking? We’ll see. As we’re walking we see Stoop talking to a very tall and skinny mycanid. We stop to talk to him but as we approach the tall one wuickly approcahes us to spore us (yup, definitely a verb) and sned panic and indignation. It tells us to stop and go no further because this place is sacred. There are giant locust/coackroach things going in and out of big ~15ft holes in the ground doing something with pods, like they’re caretakers of the pods. Once we backoff the tall one leaves and we have a little chat with Stoop. He can feel the difference between some of the mycanids. He can’t explain what it is, but some ‘feel like him’ and some feel different. The tall one feels different and was talking about the Great Seeder so he must be with Philo. He says Basidia seems like him, so that’s good. Stoop decides to come with us to see Basidia so we head back on our way togeyher. We reach Basidia’s residence and our escorts go back to the Circle of Explorers. Basidia asks us about our plans to get to the upper plateau since she’s been “locked out” and doens’t know what’s been going on. I feel a bit guilty because I kind of forgot about it. I was just focusing on killing the monsters and not dying. We need to come up with a plan but we also need to rest to recover from the last battle. Basidia says she’ll hide us at her place since we don’t know when Phylo will want us to “join the celebration”. We decide that we will take up Philo’s offer of hospitality once we’ve rested. Since my disguise trick is out of the bag I decide to have Basidia help me to blend in better when I’m transformed. Turns out, there isn’t any special way mycanids walk so I don’t need to worry about that, but if I get within ~60ft of a mycanid and it tries to communicate with me it will know somethings up because I won’t be communicating back. So I need to pick my disguise carefully and try not to get close to anyone, or try at least not be seen by anyone closer than 60ft. I do some training with Xaphan to be able to use his eyes while I walk around so that I can see in the dark. While I’m doing this Dezo is learning some stuff from Basidia but I’m pretty focused on my own thing so I’m not really sure what they’re doing. The others spend some time identifying the various scrolls and such that we have in case any of them are useful. I can use a few of them but I don’t know who much they’ll help us. "],["entry-19-confront-phylo.html", "Entry 19 - Confront Phylo", " Entry 19 - Confront Phylo 2020/10/21 After a good rest we awake in sovereign Basidia’s underground work room. She has given us some equipment as thanks for taking care of the two monster problems they’d been having. We afer gathering our things and mentally and physically preparing for whatever is to come we head out to see sovereign Phylo and the Garden of Welcome to find out what’s going on. Hopefully we’ll be able to relay something usuful to Basidia that will help the Mycanids. We entered the smog of the “new” grove which made Dezo Iankul, ad Zackham act wierd for a bit but it passed without any major accidents. We were hoping to sort of sneak around and investigate but that didn’t work at all. However, when we arrived Phylo was very excited to show us to the garden so it didn’t seem like stealth was necessary. He left us at the antrance and told us to continue. When we entered the dense mushroom forest we heard a noise that continued as we continued. Not a good noise. The way opened up to area filled with various fungal vegetations. The muffled groans (the sound we had heard earlier but coudln’t quite identify) became a droning of agony as the the varioud mounds of dirt/fungus scattered about the ground began to writhe. These were bodies, not quite dead but close. One drow had enough energy tos peak a few words of warning and plead for a quick death. Dezo fulfilled his wish and shortly after, from a tunnel of from the side of the clearing, a giant floating sphere emerged. It’s skin was slick and sickly with hundredss of small holes along the bottom side emitteing a green gas, seemingly keeping itself afloat. It had two mismatched eyes focused on the group. A demonic voice echoed in our minds and throughout the cavern. I don’t remember the words, but it was obviously not friendly. "],["entry-20-yestebrod.html", "Entry 20 - Yestebrod", " Entry 20 - Yestebrod 2020/10/28 The battle with Yestebrod, the gross floating skin ball, was long and difficult. Several ‘sentries’ came to life from the ground, the mounds we had seen. One of the sentries was Fargas. Somehow we had completely forgotten about him and didn’t notice he had wandered off (or maybe taken?) and turned into a sentry. It was clear that we were also to be made into sentries if we lost, so we didn’t hold back. When fungus-Fargas attacked Dezo didn’t hesitate. He was in lizard form at this point and bit Fargas’s half-rotten body in half. It was a hard fought battle, but I did not perform admirably. I lost consciousness twice. Early on the battle I charged two spore pod things as they approached our group, thinking I could defeat them before they attacked. I did manage to destroy them both but in so doing I caused them to literally explode… in my face. Luckily, I had Xaphan hang back so he wasn’t hurt by my idiocy. Later, Yestebrod cast some kind of fear spell that gripped me with sheer terror. I panicked and tried to run, leaving myself open to a brutal attack. However, despite my feable efforts we did manage to win the battle. With yestebrod’s death the screams of agony of all the corpses subsided to mere graons. There were still many half-rotted barely “alive” fungus zombies so I went around dispatching them to end their suffering and prevent them from being sent against us in the future. As I go I find old discarded remnans of armour and requipemnt. While I’m doing this Verril tries throwing some bodies into the big hole in the ground around which we were fighting Yestebrod. It’s a big bottomless-looking hole. Verril cast a light spell on one of the bodies to see what it does but the glowing body seemed to fall through/into something and couldn’t be seen anymore. Iankul suggests I send Xaphan down but I decline - Xaphan isn’t expendable. Verril then searches the area around where Fargas came out and finds a few nice potions that might come in handy. Just as we are starting to think about what to do next we hear something approaching. A group of feminine-looking mycanids come through the fungal forest. It appears to be a procession of celebration. They take Yestebrod’s body and carry it away. Then they seem to invite us to do… something, with outstretched arms. We just stand still dumbfounded and unsure of what is going on so they pair off amonst themselves. We then hear an unfamiliar language in our minds that is chanting some kind of poem. We all share a vision of being in a purple/fuschia room. It seems circular but looking around it is confusing and disorienting. We look down and see a feminine creature floating. It looks similar to the feminine mycanids but is three times as tall. The others are tending to it somehow. They seem to be weaving matter into existence and attaching it to the big one who is made entirely of fungi. After this we regain our senses and they return to where they came from. This was very odd, unexpected, and confusing. We are pretty beta up from the battle (especially me…) so we decide to have a rest before going off to confront sovereign Phylo, who must think us dead at this point. "],["entry-21-vernon-the-saviour.html", "Entry 21 - Vernon the saviour", " Entry 21 - Vernon the saviour 2020/11/15 As we settle down to rest Dezo spots something shiny and metalic which stands out against the mostly rusted metal of the corpses and their equipment. We are warry of surprises so Dezo uses a spell to unearth it. I then try grabbing it with Mage Hand, from a safe distance – can’t be too careful. There is a hand holding a fancy looking dagger. I lift the arm as high as I can so that I can shoot it free with an Eldritch Blast. The hand is attached to the arm of a humanoid body with no head. The clothes are tattered and appear to be empty but the clothes have the shape of containing a body. My spell easily blows the arm apart and I bring the dagger and attached hand closer. Seems there was not need for all the care I took to avoid a surprise, but I will remain vigilant! You never know when a dead hand is really a… something bad. The hand and bit of arm seem to be petrified – they look fleshy but have the consistency of chalk – and I easily break the hand off of the dagger. The dagger blade is jagged and undulating and gives off a faint glow. It’s pretty gnarly and cool. We will need to investigate it later, as it obviously has some special properties. I give it to Gilberto since he is the main dagger wielder of the group. While I’d love to carry a wicked dagger like that, it won’t do us much good in a fight for me to be casting spells from a distance while holding a dagger. Its awesomeness won’t help my aim. As I’m examining the dagger Verril checks out the body. It turns out the clothes were empty but they help the shape of a body. Verril gives me the cloak thinking it might have magical properties. I’ll try to remember to investigate it later. As we complete this transaction we start to hear a sound like creaking wood. The mounds around us start to increase the sounds of pain their exuding. Mycanids with Sovereign Phylo come into the Garden of Welcome! Two huge ones and about ten regular sized ones. We see them coming from a distance but don’t have time to get away undetected. I think fast and cast Mask of Many Faces to disguise myself as a dead sentry (a dead undead?) and lie down trying to blend into the background. Verril tries to lie his way out of the situation but they just think he is crazy and mostly ignore his words. Everyone but me is taken. Some of the others tried to feign sleep (I think Dexo might have actually been asleep) but it didn’t help them. This is bad! I am barely hanging on after that battle with Yestebrod and now my entire party has been taken captive. There is absolutely no way I can fight right now. One hit from a two foot mycanid would likely do me in. I don’t have any idea how I’m going to free them but I figure my best bet is to follow them and keep out of sight. I have Xaphan follow them from a safe distance while invisible and I follow him from further back. I also change my appearance again, to that of a regular mycanid. I know from talking to Soveriegn Basidia that as long as I don’t get close enough to another Mycanid for them to talk to me they shouldn’t be able to detect that I’m a fake. They are taking my friends to the giant mushroom tower we’ve been able to see in the distance but couldn’t approach. As we approach the tower I can see that it is truly massive. It is covered in other mushrooms sprouting out all along its height. The path winds near a river that leads to the tower, but as we get closer I realize it’s not a river of water, it’s too thick and bubbly. I don’t know what it is and I’m fine not ever finding out. The path is walled with earth and the walls are covered in mounds like we saw in the Garden of Welcome. I can only assume that every mound is body ready to rise up as a sentry. I need to be very careful. I wonder how old some of them are? They can’t be amassing sentries terribly quickly so some of these might be really old. Some of the mounds are moving, seemingly in pain. This is not a pleasant stroll, it is intense. I’m not used to have so many lives depend on just me. I’m used to my decisions only having major consequences for me and my enemies. Ahead of Phylo a mound rips open and we hear a scream of pain as dark liquid burts out and a drow falls to the ground, limp for a moment before unnaturally rising and joining Phylo. We continue on, Phylo and his posse carrying my friends, Xaphan back a ~100ft and me another ~100ft back from him, just a normal mycanid walking towards the tower. As we go the sound of constant moans of agony build and continue to build until nothing else can be heard. It then dies down again, then builds again. This cycle is not pleasant in the least. It’s really grating on my nerves but I focus on the task of saving my friends and do my best to ignore it. The ground starts to slope up as we get closer to the tower and thick purple smog sits around the base of the tower. There are puddles of viscous purple liquid sitting stagnant scattered on the path. I do my best to avoid them while still looking natural while I walk. Xaphan told me what was coming before I rounded the bend but it didn’t prepare me. He said it looked like they were having some kind of party, and he was right, but it was still a shock to witness the masses of things at the base of the tower. There were scores of deformed humanoid bodies. Draw, gnomes, durgar, knolls, mycanids, even some of those crab/locust things we saw earlier when Stoop was talking to that really tall mycanid. They were all deformed in some way: melted face, rotting/rotted sections, missing limbs, etc. The worst part was the way they were “dancing”. They moved like their body was taken over by something that wasn’t used to it yet. Some of the creatures notice Phylo adn seem to laugh to each other about how successful he is at bringing so many people to the party. One duargar laughs so hard at this that he pukes. They seem completely insance. The stress of the situation starts to get to me and I feel weird. I almost have to supress a laugh even though I definitely don’t find anything funny. I definitely don’t feel right but I can’t tell if it’s just the prolonged stress, the effects of my injuries from the previous battle, or if I’m actually going a little crazy. Phylo speaks and it snaps my attention back to the current situation. He says something like “I wanted to make an offer to the Queen but it did not work out. So this one will have to wait.” The mycanids carrying my friends then put them into the walls, each in their own mounds. They are bound and helpless so the mycanids have no trouble depositing them like seeds into ready dug plots. Phylo and his posse then move off to join the revelry. Now is my chance! I can’t wait too long or my friends will become sentries or die or I don’t know what. I can’t let myself be noticed though, or else I’ll get put into my own mound and we’ll all our fates will be sealed. I take a potion – in case we need to make a run for it I don’t want to pas out from a single stray hit – and approach the wall of friends. There are hundreds of the mycanids and humanoid grotesques scattered around the area and the closest are ~50ft away. They are really into their dancing and I look like a mycanid so I don’t draw any attention just being here standing next to a mound, especilly since anyone on the path is standing next to a mound. As I get ready to free the first of my party I send telepathic thoughts of calm. Once the message seems to be received I start excavating them - Dezo is the first. My plan is to excavate the first and have them act calm and like a sentry as we continue to excavate the rest and then act like sentries as we walk away – hopefully without any fighting. Dezo is bound in vines and has one down his throat. I cut the vines and he falls out of the mound which yanked the mouth vine out causing him to scream (oops! Sorry Dezo!). The scream goes unnoticed, likely because of the ambient screaming that builds and subsides, and the dancing and laughing of the celebration going on. Lesson learned though, do the mouht vine first and do it slowly. We manage to get everyone out without further incidence but Zackham and Gilberto are unconcious so they need to be carried. With everyone out we start walking/dancing our way back the way we came. Dancing to blend in with the crazies around us. We go in two groups, carrying the unconcious ones between two concious so it looks like they’re jovially grasping shoulders as they dance (have you seen the theatre play “Weekend at Bernie’s”? It was kind of like that). The party is still going full swing and no one seems to notice. We need to get back to Sovereign Basidia and heal up. Thankfully we have Xaphan scouting ahead for us as we go. "],["entry-22-not-out-of-the-woods-yet.html", "Entry 22 - Not out of the woods yet", " Entry 22 - Not out of the woods yet 2020/11/18 As we make our escape the mounds seem to be shifting in a way we haven’t seen before. Suddenly, all the mounds around us release aloud shriek in unison. We hurry along and as we get away from them they quiet down but then ones now near us let out a scream. Gilberto and Zackham start to wake up so we can pick up the pace. As we get back to the Garden of Welcome some of the slim feminine looking mycanids step out from the trees and attack us. We manage to defeat them without too much trouble but as things settle down we notice heavy steps reverberating in the groud coming from behind us. Not good. We realize that speed is now much more important than stealth so we set off for Basidia’s place. As we round a corner in the Garden of Welcome we see more mycanids and Gilberto hits one with a bolt from his hand-crossbow. I try to finish it off with an Elritch Blast but miss, as usual. It turns out my bad aim was fortuitous because we know these mycanids and they’re on our side! They’re from the Circle of Explorers and came to help. With that cleared up we leave quickly as the heavy steps are getting closer. Xaphan warns me that we need to get out quickly. As we get out of the Garden of Welcome Lubido and Basidia, with a bunch of other mycanids and spore servants, are waiting for us. Stoop and some of the other younglings are there too. Basidia asks us to take control of their forces in order to battle Phylo since they do not have experience with large scale battles. We can hear that Phylo is getting close so we pick a spot to stand our ground. We use the spore servants as a shield and try to pick some off from a distance. Iankul and I are in the back with our long range attacks while Verril and Zackhkam are behind the front lines directing the troops. Dezo and Gilberto are guaring the younglings. This is definitely the largest scale battle I’ve been in. It’s intense. While the battle rages, Basidia, Lupido (leader of the circle of hunters), and Rasharoo (leader of the circle of explorers) manage to open a hole in the wall for us to escape into. Most of the spore servants and some of the mycanids were lost but our party and all the younglings are fine. In this tight cave we prepare to make our final stand. It is much more in our favour than the wide open space we were in before. We hastily set up our forces at the end of the tight tunnel before it opens up into a larger cavern. Some huge tree monsters (Zerkwood) are causing a lot of damage to our forces. Basidia was communing with a big muchroom on the wall and managed to create a bit of a cave in by having roots quickly grow and push rocks out of the ceiling. She manages to kill several of the enemy and hurt the Zerkwood. The Zerkwood then charges in and I try to stop it using the last charge of my Bara’ul’s crystal to power up my Eldritch Blast. This is the last charge and I know there’s a change it could be destroyed when using the last charge but the situation calls for drastic action. That was a mistake. Immediately after my blast slams into the Zerkwood the crystal started emitting a green light and then some cracks started forming just before it exploded in my face, incapacitating me. The crystal disintegrated and return to the nine hells, lost to me forever. While I was “dead” the mycanids swarmed and finished off the Zerkwood. Verril gave me potion to revive me as another Zerkwood enters the far end of the cave. Basidia causes another cave in and seals the tunnel. There are huge roots sticking out of the ceiling where the rocks fell from but they quickly retreat back into the rock and Basidia releases the mushroom she was “talking to” and tried to walk towards us but stumbles from exhaustion. She says she has done all she can but we need to move from here and find somewhere to put in a foothold and talk in safety. "],["entry-23-prepare-for-war.html", "Entry 23 - Prepare for war", " Entry 23 - Prepare for war 2020/11/25 Basidia knows of a safe place we can go so she leads us waya. As we go there are no more bioluminescent mushrooms or soft ground. We transition to pitch black and stone. THe tunnel gradually narrows until have to crouch and are brushing against the walls. We get to a ledge and descend a collection of small cliffs. Eventually, we arrive at a place Basidia considers safe and we begin to explain what happened to us. Verril leads the explanation to Basidia. Basidia is confused and curious. Verril says Yestebrod was the great seeder but he called it a “he” and Basidia says Phylo called the great seeder “she”. Silly Verril. Dezo appologizes for attaching Rashoroo and Vasidia says we should appologize to Rasharoo directly. I try explaining about the weird vision we had of the purple room but I can’t remember enough details for it to make sense to her. Basidia expresses fear and worry. We see that this is working so we decide to try melding with them in order to share our memories and hopefully she’ll be able to make sense of what we saw. We should be well rested before attempting to meld so we try to rest. I curl up in the corner with Xaphan and sleep hard. I got knocked out several times in these fights. More than once by having things explode in my face. I am exhausted and despite what’s going on I have no trouble falling into a deep sleep right away. As I’m sleeping I awak to a building laugh that reaches a full on cackle. My patron is laughing at me for killing myself. He says it bought me some time but I still have to kill one of these people soon. ???What??? Something seems off with my patron. Something more odd than usual, but I can’t put my finger on it. This is troubling but not my top concern at the moment. I startle awake following this disturbing interaction with my patron. There is a big light, like the palm of a giant hand made of light that covers me and squahses me down. I feel hot and cold like I’ve got the flu. Once that’s done (whatever it is) I pass out almost immediately and finish sleeping. We all meld with the mycanids. It’s an odd experience. They all seem to glow faintly and a musty smell emanates from them and burns my nostrils a little. I briefly fall into a state of euphoria and feel a connection to nature unlike anything else I’ve ever experienced. As that passes I feel what the mycanids have been feeling recently with whole Phylo situation and the I see all of our memories from the garden of welcome. We eventually go through everyone’s recent memories and thoughts and gain a better understanding of Vasidia, Rasharoo, and Lubamud. I feel like a real connection has been made between my party and the mycanids, as well as between us members of the party. We saw parts of each other that we wouldn’t normally share but since everyone was laid bare we’re still on equal footing and it doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable knowing they’ve seen my true thoughts and feelings, and they feel likewise. The sharing of thoughts and memories doesn’t happen in a linear fashion, it kind of all happens at once, but also slowly. It’s as if we are given all the information at once and then slowly decipher it all at the same time (at least for me). As the melding concludes with everyone having internally sorted and decipherd the massive amount of information we just ingested, panick spreads aming the mycanids. Vasidia informs us that the Great Seeder is actually the Lady of Decay, Zigmoy. Rasharoo says she is a demon queen from a different plane. They also inform us that Ystrabrod was once a mycanid. That took a second to sink in: that floating gross ball of eyes used to be a mycanid?!?! They tell us that Zigmoy may want to join with the “lifeblood of everyting” (I didn’t catch the name) at “Araumycos” (spelling?) to corrupt the lifeblood and take it over in order to conquer the world. This is very bad news. Vasidia doesn’t think we’ll be able to do anything about Zigmoy on our own, we need allies either in the underdark or from the surface. THe demon queen seems to be amassing an army so we need to do likewise. I asked Vasidia how much time we have before the “invasion” but she doesn’t know. Rasharoo tells us there are “stout softers” nearby that they think have a way to the surface. We suppose that the stout softers are durgar but it’s hard to tell from the mycanid’s description and they don’t understand our attempts to differentiate the various kinds of “softers”. Either way, Rasharoo has had dealing with them without incident in the past and gives us a necklace with an anvil and flame medalion that may help us (I’m not sure how, hopefully someone else was paying closer attention than I was). Vasidia doesn’t seem hopeful about our situation but after some discussion it is decided that Vasidia and the mycanids will go to Aramikos (spelling?) and set up a base camp to wait for us to return with an army. Rasharoo will send a couple of guides with us to help us find the “stout softers”. We say our goodbyes (including a heartwarming show of affection from Dezo for Stoop) and we get ready set off to find an army with our two mycanid guides. "],["entry-24-screeches-are-never-good.html", "Entry 24 - Screeches are never good", " Entry 24 - Screeches are never good 2020/12/02 I was about to start walking when Iankul brings up our dream and Zigmoy again. Verril starts talking about a pre-emptive strike at the grove (that we just barely managed to escape from…really Verril?) Verril then starts asking Vasidia about the demon spores that infected so many of the mycanids and if there is a way to detect them. Vasidia informs us that any mycanid can detect them and our guides are at our disposal as long as we need them so we’ll be able to detect them if we need to. Since talk have re-opened and our departure temporarily on hold, Vasidia decides to ask Dezo to try a special type of spore “technique” to establish long range communication. She chooses him because of his skills with nature-related magics. Vasidia has never tried this before so doesn’t know if it will work and it might hurt Dezo but he isn’t daunted by a little danger. He agrees to give it a try but almost immediately after whatever Vasidia is doing begins he starts to look very uncomfortable and it seems to intensify until he falls to the ground screeming with blood dripping out of this nose and eyes. It’s obvious to everyone, even Gilberto gagging a few paces off, that it did not work. Oh well, Dezo is still alive so not too much harm done. That display somewhat spoiled the mood for further inquiries so we finally set off for real. Our new guides are Alop and Jolaba (sp?) and they lead the way out of the cave. For safety’s sake I disguise myself as Erugg (sp?) (that creepy old duargar we met before) and have Xaphan ride on my shoulder invisible so I can see through his eyes and gain the benefits of his dark vision. The melding took a lot out of us, and then the following discissions took a while, and Dezo went through his little mishap, and it’s been many hours since we first set out, so it doens’t take long for us to tire and need to slow our pace. We have our guides find us a resting spot and huker down a nice rejuvinating respite. Before laying down though, I try to do some training with Xaphan to improve our coordination when I see through his eyes. He doesn’t take it seriously though so we don’t really make any progress. I don’t want to be harsh with him, I want him to want to work with me. I’ll have to try again but I think I need to find a motivation for him to improve his focus. While on watch Iankul saw soemthing but it ran off before he could determine what it was. Other than that we rested without incident and woke up ready to continue our march. After several monotonous hours of stone tunnels we come to a plateau and hear a kind of croaking noise in the distance. It soon turns into a horrific screeching. We then see a group huamoids with elongated limbs and jaws that approach from the plateau. ghouls! They aren’t very tough but they do a lot of damage if they can get their hands on you, and there are a lot of them. "],["entry-25-its-ghoul-to-meet-you.html", "Entry 25 - It’s ghoul to meet you", " Entry 25 - It’s ghoul to meet you 2020/12/16 As the battle is coming to an end we see a ghoul about to jump at us from the plateay above get impaled by a spear. Four people in full plate armour and helmets come into few shortly after. They were fighting ghouls above while we were battling them below. These four identify themselves as “the Grey Knights”. They come from the Fog Fjord which is one ro two hours away. They go on to contiue hunting ghouls but tell us we would be welcome in their settlement and they’ll be back there shortly. We decided we might as well check out the settlement and the Grey Knights’ leader says mention them to the guards to ensure safe entry. He also tells us not to be surprised by what we see there and assures us it’s ok. This is intriguing and a little concerning but we figure we’ll take him at his word that’s ok and I at least, am looking forward to the surprise. What could it be? Are they cat people? Lizard people? Do they keep giant spiders as pets? Does the settlement float in the air? I enjoy the distraction from thinking about the possible end of the world at the hands of a demon queen. We walk for about 40 minutes without incident until we reach an area that is very cold that has crumbled rock strewn about. We see a large gash in the tunnel wall and hear a powerful wind inside it but can’t see antyhing but darkness at first. After peering into the darkness for a few moments our eyes start to adjust and we can see a faintly glowing platform several hundred feet away and below us. Near one edge of the platform we see what looks like a settlement and on the opposite edge a series of jagged stalactites and stalagmites. Suddenly, Iankul notices a swarm of fleshy giant bat-like creatues swoop towards us and yells for us to duck just in time to avoid…whatever would have happened if they flew right into us. Close call! We descend through the gash to get to the settlement. As we approach the settlement we see that there is a large makeshift wall with a walkway inside the wall where people are prtrolling. We call out to the guards and tell them the Grey Knights invited us and we are warmly welcomed in. Dezo asks about an inn and we get directions to the “Cat’s Claw”. As we walk through the town we are somewhat shocked by how much it looks like a surface town, although everything is built from “mushroom wood” instead of typical surface wood. We see some workers chopping down a large ‘tree’, some fences with with floating brains with tentacles and beaks. Some of them fall the the groud and dig around in the mud, creating a floating sphere of dirt and mud that I struggle to determine is cute or gross. There are close to ten of these creatures and they seem to be tethered like livestock. I mentally name them “bird brains” just so I have something to call them. Dezo goes over for a closer inspection. He tells us that they have no eyes, their tentacles are barbed and venemous, and they seem intelligent. Is this what the Grey Knights tried to prepare us for? If so, they have a low threshhold for weird. We arrive at the Cat’s Claw and start talking with the innkeeper. He is also from the surface but has been here for many years. He is talkative and friendly. While his character seems top knotch, his appearance could use some work. He is thin and gaunt, missing some teeth, adn generally unkept. Having been in the underdark for many years though, I’ll reserve any judgement on his appearance. As we talk with the inkeep, Galdry, further we start to learn some interesting things about the settlement. People seem to just wake up one the shore near the settlement which is how it got started and then grew. It’s unknown how/why people wake up on the shore and no one ever remembers how they got here. There used to be more Grey Knights but the others are missing (that’s odd…) and there are only four right now. The bird brains are called grel. I prefer bird brains but I suppose to make myself better understood I just call them grel from now on. Also, they eat them. The “founder” is “in charge” of the Fog Fjord but he keeps to himself. Dezo asks about speaking with him but Galdry says “at this hour it’s not a good idea”. This is also a bit odd. Now that I think of it, maybe the knights were preparing us for the fact that this town is apparently magically populated by people with no memories? Again, not that weird. After our chat we decide to get some grel stew. The bowls it’s served in, like everything in the settlement, is a hodgepodge of practicle items. They don’t match, but they function well. The stewa warms us up and is comforting after our long cold and dark marching. Verril, Zackham, and I all try a grel bitters. As Galdry brings them out we three all down them in one go before he has a chance to tell us it’s meant to be sipped. My tongue and cheeks have a brief moment of searing pain before the numbness sets in. We three can’t talk properly anymore. I suppose this is due to the venom in the grel tentacles - the main component of grel bitters. After this hilarity, we a couple of rooms. A suite for the 6 of us adventurers and a room next door for the mycanids. We also do some more proper introductions of the group, including Xaphan. Galdry isn’t too pleased about Xaphan but accepts that I take responsibility for this actions. In hind sight, I probably should have left Xapahan out of the introductions and kept him invisible. Oh well. We head up to our rooms to get some rest. I do a bit of training with Xaphan and he seems to take to it a bit more this time. We have worked out the kinks of how to coordinate his vision when he’s sitting on my shoulders and I’m walking around. I can even use his vision to aim my spells, which is super useful! Unfortunately though, it takes a fair amount of concentration to see through his eyes and still control my body so for some spells I have to come entirely back to myself before casting. I am still troubled by our experience in Neverlight Grove and something doesn’t feel right inside of me. Hopefully it will pass with time. After our pre-sleep rituals we all lie down in beds! and go to sleep. We end up having a shared dream when we feel like we’re falling, almost like vertigo, and can hear screaches and voices calling out, I couldn’t make out most of the voices, something about “free us”… maybe. We all wake up together and feel terrible. I feel fatigues and lethargic, physically and mentally. There is a scream outside and the sound of running on the roof. I send Xaphan out to have a look. Ghouls seem to be attacking the setttlement. There is also a dense fog outside that greatly reduces vision. There is a bell being rung at irregular intervals somewhere nearby. It seems the Grey Knights are not back yet so we decided to help out. As we gear-up and go downstairs we see Galdry talking to someone and we ask them what’s going on. Galdry tells us that when he said “people wake up here” wasn’t quite accurate. The new people have to do with when this fog rolls in. As he’s talking I notice he looks different. He was always gaunt but now it is much more pronounced and he seems almost stretched out. Through some discussion we discover several important pieces of information: everyone in Fog Fjord was once a rampaging ghoul the fog reverts them to a mindless rampaging state the fog doesn’t seem to be able to penetrate inside if the doors and windows are closed we can save the ghouls by tying them up - they’ll become “normal” once the fog leaves We decide to help the town. Galdry asks us to investigate the livestock and/or the workforce and help anyone conscious get holed up somewhere safe. As we leave a small amount of fog get inside and it immediately affects Galdry. He suddenly becomes even more gaunt and desicated, so we quickly close the door behind us. We aren’t sure if the fog will have any effect on us so Dezo casts a wind spell that creates a vortex aroud him that dispereses the fog and we all enter it. Unfortunately, we can’t hear anything while in this vortex but we head towards where the bell sound was coming from since the fog seems to be coming from that direction. We find a small 5’ x 5’ platform and a mangled, decayed, and desicated human missing its lower jaw and tied to a pillar. A rope is tied to one hand and the bell. The arm is spasming, causing the bell to ring. This seems to be a crude alarm system for the fog. Verril leaves Dezo’s protective wind to see if he can see or hear anything. He can’t see more than a few feet because of the fog but he hears fighting coming from the direction we came from. We all suddenly hear a scream in our minds that is so intense it is physically painful. I don’t know what that was about but we don’t have time to talk about it right now so we just head back towards the Cat’s Claw and the livestock area. We try going to the livestock keeper’s hut, hoping to get their help, thinking that they’ll stay sane inside Dezo’s wind. However, there is no one in the hut. Next we try the barn but on our way we see several grel corpses with most of their “heads” gone, likely eaten. We check the barn and it seems we are too late. There are no more grel alive, but there are several ghouls that we now have to deal with. The fact that they can be turned into regular “people” means we have to try not to kill them, but that’s easy to forget when they’re trying to rip your throat out. "],["entry-26-we-save-ghouls-now.html", "Entry 26 - We save ghouls now?", " Entry 26 - We save ghouls now? 2021/01/06 Considering how easy a ghoul is to kill, this fight is tough. The fog limiting our vision, the sheer number of them, and the fact that we’re trying to not kill them, really ups the challenge. Some of us are outside but some are inside the barn. I couldn’t see or hear anything going on in the barn so I just had to trust that they were ok. Xapahn’s vision doesn’t help with fog so even using his eyes I could only see ten feet in front of me. I eventually got the idea to send Xaphan up about 30 feet into the air to get a view of the battlefield. The fog is heavy and is thickest close to the ground so I hoped he would be able to see something from up high. I can make out where people are since we are thankfully all tall-ish. Once I look through Xaphan I notice that there are two ghouls at the end of Dezo wind spell attacking the Mycanids! Unfortunately I can’t aim with Xaphan’s sight when he isn’t on my shoulder so I have to move closer and signal the others to protect the mycanids. I should try to train with Xaphan for aiming spells when he isn’t on my shoulder When all was said and done, Verril got paralyzed, and Iankul and a mycanid got knocked out and needed to be revived. Really, Iankul, again? Maybe you need to work on your positioning. We managed to knock out several of the ghouls without killing them so we then started tying them up and putting them in the grel cages in the barn. Dezo’s wind spell wears off as we finish securing the still-living-undead and we can suddenly hear again. The bell is still ringing but we don’t hear any sounds of fighting. We decided to go check out the worker area where we saw them cutting down a tree earlier. There is a bit of a compound there so presumably several people that potentially need help. I send Xaphan but up and share his sight while holding onto Dezo. I can’t make out any details, I just see silhouettes of the top of people. We are only but more than a hundred feet from the worker area but it seems to take ages to walk over there because of the damn fog. From Xaphan’s point of view there doesn’t seem to be anyone outside, which I suppose is a good thing. We check the buildings in the worker compound. The doors are locked and there are scratches on the doors, walls, and shutters. We get a response from a few of the doors from scared people hiding out until the fog passes. After we check all the buildings we gather to chat about what to do next. It seems like there is nothing left for us to do so we head back to the Cat’s Claw. Iankul has a bit of a panic attack about the fog and the fact that we are breathing it and what’s going on blah blah blah. He doesn’t seem “dangerous crazy” so Dezo just asks Verril to keep an eye on him in case his ‘condition’ gets worse. The door is locked at the in (or maybe something is blocking it) so we can’t walk right in. Iankul freaks out a bit and does a running shoulder charge straight at the door, it isn’t very effective. I call out to Galdry to let us in and he opens the door. Just as he starts to open it Iankul does a second shoulder charge and he goes lfying into the inn like a buffoon. We all go in wuickly after him and Galdri closes the door behind us. Galdri and Carl and stull just hanging out with hammers but now there are also two corpses on the ground (unconcious or dead?). "],["entry-27-the-founder.html", "Entry 27 - The Founder", " Entry 27 - The Founder 2021/01/20 NOTE I missed this session. I listened to the audio recoridng while doing other things and later made some very brief notes. After all that excitment I’m pretty tired and am having trouble paying attention to what the group is doing. We got chatted with Galdry some more trying to get information but he didn’t know much. The Grey Knights returned and we went with them to check the aftermath of the fog. It turns out that this is the first time the fog has come twice in quick succession. There is normally a long break between fogs. This is why the Grey Knights weren’t around; they were still out hunting down ghouls from the previous fog a few days ago. The settlement is at the end of a lake and the edge of the lake is where new people come from. When the fog comes is rolls in from across the lake. We learn that they can’t go far from the settlement, if they do they lose control and become mindless ghouls. They are essentially trapped in the town. We decide we’d like to investigate this lake to see where the fog is coming from. We decide to go see the founder first through. While most of us go to talk to the founder, Verril and the mycanids stay behind to build a boat for crossing the lake. The founder is an interesting fellow, but definitely a bit crazy. He forbids investigation of the source of the fog. He rambles on about “Tomin the betrayer” who is the one tied to the bell. This Tomin apparently tried to investigate the fog before, against the founder’s wishes. I didn’t catch all of the conversation but I think the others were paying closer attention so I’m sure they’ll bring up any relevant points later if it’s important. We didn’t get much else out of the Founder as he kind of went into a stupor or something. The knights say he is lucid all that often so I guess we should be glad we got at least a few minutes of understandable conversation. "],["entry-28-.html", "Entry 28 - ?", " Entry 28 - ? 2021/02/03 When we get back from talking to the founder Verril hasn’t made much (any) progress on the boat. When we went into the forest with the mycanids they found a zyrkwood that they said was their kin. THey tried to meld with it and it seemed to almost kill one of the mycanids. It’s alive but really worn out and will need time to recover so won’t be coming with us for now. The melding wasn’t fruitless though, they got some interesting information. The trees say that the fog is corrupted but only affects the dead (good news for us!). The founder arrived after the first fog - the trees had already been there a very long time. When the founder came ashore he was clushing something and he stoof still for many cycles before doing anything. He then started cutting the Zurkwoods to build the town. The trees have been cut down in greater numbers as the town grows so they have requested that we talk to town about maintining balance with the forest. Seems like a very reasonable request. After telling us this story Verril goes to finish/start the boat with the other mycanid. Zachkam and Gilberto decide to do some investigating around town to ask people what they know about the fog, their past, how they got here, whatever they can remember. The others… damn, I can’t remember what the rest of the group did. Maybe some of them helped Verril, I’m not sure. Anyway, I went off with Xaphan to do some light training and get to know him better and explore the twon. We made great progress. I can aim just as well through his eyes as my own, even when he’s flying above me! This could really help us out in the future. Having made good progress in our training we start to walk back to the inn and I take this opportunity to have a bit of a heart-to-heart with him to try to understand him better. One-on-one side session 2021/02/09 I have been thinking of things I want to ask Xaphan for a while but haven’t really had the time to talk to him one-on-one, so I’m happy to have this chance. I find out a lot about him. Note: I am greatly paraphrasing Xaphan’s replies, these are not word for word answers. Vernon: Have you been someone’s familiar before? Xaphan: No, you’re my first. Vernon: Do you report to my patron directly on my activities or does he just watch me through your eyes from time to time? Xaphan: He checks in from time to time and asks me what you’ve been up to but he can also see through my eyes whenever he wants. Vernon: Do you have any likes or hates? Xaphan: I hate elves, spiders are cool. I really like succubi. Out of respect for you I haven’t done anything to the elf in your party but just say the word and we can take him out. He doesn’t hate as many things as I would have thought, for an imp. Not that I know any other imps… Vernon: Do you have any friends? Xaphan: What is a friend? I have comrades through contract, is that what you mean? He doesn’t seem to really understand what friendship is. I guess it’s not really a thing for devils. I ask him about devils and he tells my they fight the abyss. Devils fight the demons to protect the whoe world (they sound like the good guys, weird). Zygmoid is a demon queen so she is a natural enemy of devils. Defeating her could result in my patron and/or Xaphan getting a promotion. I ask if the devils would help us with an army for fighting Zygmoid and Xaphan tells me they would certainly negotiate a contract to provide a devil army. That is both promising and terrifying. It cost me my soul and some of my free will just to not be killed by my patron, what would it cost to requisition an entire army? I’ll mull this over before bringing it to the group as a solution to the army problem. Plus, we have this fog to deal with first. Vernon: Do you have ambition? Is there something beyond being a familiar that you’d like to achieve? Xaphan: Of course! Devils all want to move up the hiararchy. Imp isn’t the lowest rank, but it’s low. Since I’m still new to the “devil scene” I ask for more information and he tells me that Mamon (sp?) is the arch devil in charge of Mindros (sp?), a level of hell where my patron and Xaphon live and it’s where I’ll go when I die, because of my contract. Vernon: How do you move up the ranks? Xaphan: By doing a good job, such as keeping you alive and being useful so you can do do your work for our patron. Vernon: What do you like to do for fun? Xaphan: I like to stir shit up, watch you kill stuff. Although, undead aren’t very fun since they have no soul. I like to trick people, burn things. I like blood in general so anything involving a lot of blood is usually a good time. I also like shiny things; gems, jewwlry, shiny rocks, gold, etc. Since we come accross a lot of dead bodies, often with clothing/jewelry present, I tell Xapahan that if I find a nice shiny ring without magical properties, I’ll give it to him. This confuses him, he isn’t familiar with being nice (see what I did there?). I eventually persuade him that I’m genuine in offering a ring without strings attached and he is pleasantly surprised, but still confused. I think I’m making progress on Xaphan becoming a real friend. We still have a long way to go though. He seems to have enjoyed this experience and believes me when I say I’m grateful for his help and offers to help me even more. He tells me that if I give him some of my blood then he can share some of his protection against magic with me. I am sceptical at first and I immediately ask “how much blood?” but it’s a very small amount, a few thimbles at most… every day. My soul in already forfeit and he seems eager to help so I agree. He magically pulls out some parchment from a puff of smoke and writes up the contract. GET THE TEXT FROM THE CONTRACT IN FOUNDRY I have a look over it and we sign in blood. When I pressed my bloody thumb against the contract a tatoo-looking sign appeared on my palm, marking the contract. Xaphan looks very pleased. I give him my pinky finger to collect payment for the first day. It’s a bit weird and slightly painful to have him bite into my finger and suck on it for about 10 seconds, but it could save my life and I’ve done much weirder things before so I don’t mind. It also brings Xaphan and me together. The stipulation that any missed days must be made up as soon as possible has me a bit worried. What if we get separated for a while for whatever reason? Will he suck me dry once we meet back up? Basically, yes. So I’ll need to get some empty potion jars and start storing my blood. After he takes his daily allotment, I’ll store a day in a bottle. Before long I’ll have a nice supply in case it’s ever needed. My Bag of Colding will keep it fresh. Also, I checked with Xaphan and this is an acceptable form of payment. Having concluded our business out of view, we head back onto the main street and return to the inn. End of side-session When we got back to the inn… NOT DONE. FINISH THIS JOURNAL ENTRY "],["appendix.html", "Appendix PCs NPCs", " Appendix Vernon kept some notes at the back of his journal so he wouldn’t forget important details about people… or simply so he wouldn’t forget why they were in his journal. Regardless of the reason, they are included here. PCs Player Character Notes Willy Vernon Vickies, verdan warlock Hates corrupt nobles. Likes helping people in need. Has a pact with a demon that demands killing in exchange for not devouring his soul. The demon also bestows magical powers. Can potentially change gender when attributes change. Alex Gilberto, human rogue Weak stomach around gore. Strong opinions. Fetwi Zakham Ruhle, human bard A bit silly. Very helpful. Phil Dezo the Walker, druid Calm, inquisitive. Mohamed Verril, barbarian Pretty dumb but has a good heart. Does whatever he feels like without any thought of consequences. And I thought I was rash sometimes… Andrei Iankul Duskwalker, archer, elf Found in a slaver wagon, kind of like me. Seems like a reliable fellow. Hicham Ryker, cleric, human Found burried/cucooned in the underdark near the Fog Fjord while searching for the source of the fog. NPCs Name Notes Vawen Lowwe’elai In my original party. Elf woman. Broke her leg in the carriage carnage. Needs help moving, being carried by Prince Darrendil. Was ritualistically murdered while we slept. The killer is unknown, as is the motivation for the murder. Dorn Ironskull In my original party. Dwarf fighter. Lost conciousness in the carriage carnage from a head wound. Doesn’t talk much. Something happeend between him and Gilberto in the fog, but he doesn’t seem to be holding a grudge. Trudging along not saying much, but carrying his own weight. Tav Torin In my original party. Half elf mage. Decapitated during the carriage carnage. Prince Darrendil Huge and strong. Apparently an elven prince that got turned into a quaggoth. Seems intelligent and polite. He carryied Vawen because of her leg, without complaint. Seemed like a good fellow. Goes into a rage in battle. After we fought the fungus-undead things he went berserk and ran ahead. He ended up fighting a bunch of drow and died. We don’t know why he went crazy. It’s definitely a loss for the party. Neznar Drow male who was also a prisoner. The party helped him escape so he is helping them get where they need to go. Doesn’t say a lot. Wanted us to get rid of Vawen because “she’s a liability”. He has a mark on the side of his head that looks like a series of moles or some kind of infection that was left untreated, I’m not sure - he claims it’s a birthmark. He also mutters to himself a lot. I can’t tell if he’s a bit unhinged or just odd. I believe him when he sas he will take us where we’re going, Neverlight Grove. I believe him when he says he didn’t kill Vawyn, it doens’t seem like something he would do, but if he’s unhinged/infected, who knows what might be affecting him or taking control when he’s not aware? He’s good in a fight so I hope he’s on our side… Stoop A miconid (looks like a mushroom) that can communicate telepathically with the party. It seems very friendly and we are trying to bring it home to Neverlight Grove, in the underdark. I don’t know where it came from but it sounds like it was ‘born’ recently in the drow camp. Boopido An old gnome that always seems scared or surprised. He was a prisoner and escaped with my new friends. My patron wanted me to kill him or Vawyn (I think). In our first battle he ran and hid. I don’t trust him, but that’s probably what my patron wants…so should I trust him? He’s scared of me and definitely doesn’t trust me, so it doens’t really matter I guess. Update: that bloody asshole was the murderder. We avenged our friends and took him down. Yuk Yuk The shorter of the two goblin guides helping us cross the Silken Paths. Upbeat, friendly, fond of shiny things. A very aggreeable goblin. Knows the webs well and I find myself trusting him easily Spider Bait The taller of the two goblin guides helping us cross the Silken Paths. Tall for a goblin but still only about shoulder height on me. He is a stark contrast to his companion. He talks slowly in a monotone voice and dressly much more plainly, with only a single plain earing for jewelry. Despite his somewhat morose demeanor I enjoy his company and find myself trusing him easily. Fargas Rumblefoot He was crossing the webs with Yuk Yuk and Spider Bait when he got caught by some spiders. We freed him while looting some cocoons we came accross. He seems excitable but that may have just been the circumstances. He seems to have lost an item of importance. We need to find out more about this fellow. Errug An old garnled halfing-dwarf wizard. He’s shifty and clever but not a bad bloke. "]]
