<h1>Entry 28 - ?</h1>
<p><span class="journaldate">2021/02/03</span></p>
<p>When we get back from talking to the founder Verril hasn’t made much (any) progress on the boat. When we went into the forest with the mycanids they found a zyrkwood that they said was their kin. THey tried to meld with it and it seemed to almost kill one of the mycanids. It’s alive but really worn out and will need time to recover so won’t be coming with us for now.</p>
<p>The melding wasn’t fruitless though, they got some interesting information. The trees say that the fog is corrupted but only affects the dead (good news for us!). The founder arrived after the first fog - the trees had already been there a very long time. When the founder came ashore he was clushing something and he stoof still for many cycles before doing anything. He then started cutting the Zurkwoods to build the town. The trees have been cut down in greater numbers as the town grows so they have requested that we talk to town about maintining balance with the forest. Seems like a very reasonable request.</p>
<p>After telling us this story Verril goes to finish/start the boat with the other mycanid. Zachkam and Gilberto decide to do some investigating around town to ask people what they know about the fog, their past, how they got here, whatever they can remember. The others… damn, I can’t remember what the rest of the group did. Maybe some of them helped Verril, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Anyway, I went off with Xaphan to do some light training and get to know him better and explore the twon. We made great progress. I can aim just as well through his eyes as my own, even when he’s flying above me! This could really help us out in the future.</p>
<p>Having made good progress in our training we start to walk back to the inn and I take this opportunity to have a bit of a heart-to-heart with him to try to understand him better.</p>
<div id="one-on-one-side-session" class="section level4">
<h4>One-on-one side session</h4>
<p><span class="journaldate">2021/02/09</span></p>
<p>I have been thinking of things I want to ask Xaphan for a while but haven’t really had the time to talk to him one-on-one, so I’m happy to have this chance. I find out a lot about him.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: I am greatly paraphrasing Xaphan’s replies, these are not word for word answers.</p>
<p><span class="vernon"><strong>Vernon</strong></span>: <em>Have you been someone’s familiar before?</em><br>
<span class="xaphan"><strong>Xaphan</strong></span>: <em>No, you’re my first.</em></p>
<p><span class="vernon"><strong>Vernon</strong></span>: <em>Do you report to my patron directly on my activities or does he just watch me through your eyes from time to time?</em><br>
<span class="xaphan"><strong>Xaphan</strong></span>: <em>He checks in from time to time and asks me what you’ve been up to but he can also see through my eyes whenever he wants.</em></p>
<p><span class="vernon"><strong>Vernon</strong></span>: <em>Do you have any likes or hates?</em><br>
<span class="xaphan"><strong>Xaphan</strong></span>: <em>I hate elves, spiders are cool. I </em>really <em>like succubi. Out of respect for you I haven’t done anything to the elf in your party but just say the word and we can take him out.</em></p>
<p>He doesn’t hate as many things as I would have thought, for an imp. Not that I know any other imps…</p>
<p><span class="vernon"><strong>Vernon</strong></span>: <em>Do you have any friends?</em><br>
<span class="xaphan"><strong>Xaphan</strong></span>: <em>What is a friend? I have comrades through contract, is that what you mean?</em></p>
<p>He doesn’t seem to really understand what friendship is. I guess it’s not really a thing for devils. I ask him about devils and he tells my they fight the abyss. Devils fight the demons to protect the whoe world (they sound like the good guys, weird). Zygmoid is a demon queen so she is a natural enemy of devils. Defeating her could result in my patron and/or Xaphan getting a promotion. I ask if the devils would help us with an army for fighting Zygmoid and Xaphan tells me they would certainly negotiate a contract to provide a devil army. That is both promising and terrifying. It cost me my soul and some of my free will just to not be killed by my patron, what would it cost to requisition an entire army? I’ll mull this over before bringing it to the group as a solution to the army problem. Plus, we have this fog to deal with first.</p>
<p><span class="vernon"><strong>Vernon</strong></span>: <em>Do you have ambition? Is there something beyond being a familiar that you’d like to achieve?</em><br>
<span class="xaphan"><strong>Xaphan</strong></span>: <em>Of course! Devils all want to move up the hiararchy. Imp isn’t the lowest rank, but it’s low.</em></p>
<p>Since I’m still new to the “devil scene” I ask for more information and he tells me that Mamon (sp?) is the arch devil in charge of Mindros (sp?), a level of hell where my patron and Xaphon live and it’s where I’ll go when I die, because of my contract.</p>
<p><span class="vernon"><strong>Vernon</strong></span>: <em>How do you move up the ranks?</em><br>
<span class="xaphan"><strong>Xaphan</strong></span>: <em>By doing a good job, such as keeping you alive and being useful so you can do do your work for our patron.</em></p>
<p><span class="vernon"><strong>Vernon</strong></span>: <em>What do you like to do for fun?</em><br>
<span class="xaphan"><strong>Xaphan</strong></span>: <em>I like to stir shit up, watch you kill stuff. Although, undead aren’t very fun since they have no soul. I like to trick people, burn things. I like blood in general so anything involving a lot of blood is usually a good time. I also like shiny things; gems, jewwlry, shiny rocks, gold, etc.</em></p>
<p>Since we come accross a lot of dead bodies, often with clothing/jewelry present, I tell Xapahan that if I find a nice shiny ring without magical properties, I’ll give it to him. This confuses him, he isn’t <em>familiar</em> with being nice (see what I did there?). I eventually persuade him that I’m genuine in offering a ring without strings attached and he is pleasantly surprised, but still confused. I think I’m making progress on Xaphan becoming a real friend. We still have a long way to go though.</p>
<p>He seems to have enjoyed this experience and believes me when I say I’m grateful for his help and offers to help me even more. He tells me that if I give him some of my blood then he can share some of his protection against magic with me. I am sceptical at first and I immediately ask “how much blood?” but it’s a very small amount, a few thimbles at most… every day. My soul in already forfeit and he seems eager to help so I agree.</p>
<p>He magically pulls out some parchment from a puff of smoke and writes up the contract.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:72pt;">GET THE TEXT FROM THE CONTRACT IN FOUNDRY</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a look over it and we sign in blood. When I pressed my bloody thumb against the contract a tatoo-looking sign appeared on my palm, marking the contract.</p>
<p><img src="media/palm_mark_1.png" alt="palm mark" height="100"></p>
<p>Xaphan looks very pleased. I give him my pinky finger to collect payment for the first day. It’s a bit weird and slightly painful to have him bite into my finger and suck on it for about 10 seconds, but it could save my life and I’ve done much weirder things before so I don’t mind. It also brings Xaphan and me together.</p>
<p>The stipulation that any missed days must be made up as soon as possible has me a bit worried. What if we get separated for a while for whatever reason? Will he suck me dry once we meet back up? Basically, yes. So I’ll need to get some empty potion jars and start storing my blood. After he takes his daily allotment, I’ll store a day in a bottle. Before long I’ll have a nice supply in case it’s ever needed. My Bag of Colding will keep it fresh. Also, I checked with Xaphan and this is an acceptable form of payment.</p>
<p>Having concluded our business out of view, we head back onto the main street and return to the inn.</p>
